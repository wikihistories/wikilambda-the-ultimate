	abstract = {The growing influence of English Wikipedia as a provider of information has created powerful new gatekeepers and publishing practices that determine not only what constitutes knowledge in the online world, but whose knowledge is privileged. The structural inequalities of the offline world are being reproduced online, creating new sites for information imperialism. Research shows western contributors are overwriting local knowledge, perpetuating western narratives, and presenting cultures through an outsider lens, resulting in subtle and not so subtle forms of hegemonic cultural dominance. Nonetheless, Wikipedias have multi-media capabilities, which can be utilized by oral cultures as well as providing new asynchronous online meeting places where communities can continue their social imaginings. This paper considers the impacts of English Wikipedia on global knowledge equity and cognitive justice. It analyzes two articles about Bhutanese culture to demonstrate the risks of dilution brought by western ontological expansiveness, and argues that, by contrast, the Dzongkha Wikipedia offers an online space mostly inaccessible to outsiders, and thus a bulwark where the community can continue its cultural conversations in ways not possible before Web 2.0 technologies.},

Nate’s thesis is that “openness” provides the logic for Wikipedia’s politics. This thesis has a practical significance for wikihistories. If we want to address the foundation effectively, we might frame our analysis and suggestions in terms of openness. We could characterise the flaws we identify as ‘closures’, and the reforms we suggest as ‘openings’.
Introduction
3 – Aim: “This book offers a consideration of political developments that operate under the notion of openness.”
4 – A crucial point about Wikipedia’s form: “… Wikipedia was a massive attempt to make a single, unified thing.” – Wikipedia really is an object.
6 - “The mere fact of participation seemed largely meaningless when it was clear that although anyone with an Internet connection could technically edit, there were absolutely no guarantees that an edit would stick.”
*7 – Key characterisation of “politics”: “the political aspects of working together” = “how some contributions were chosen at the expense of others and how these decisions marked contributors in asymmetrical ways.”
7 – Openness is key because it is Wikipedia’s official ideology: “To think politically about Wikipedia, one had first to pass through openness.”
10 – Method: “… I dive into selected events and cases from Wikipedia’s history chosen specifically for what they reveal about the organizational qualities of the project in relation to openness.”
*11 – How the logic of openness precludes action on representation. (Great paragraph, too long to type)
--{\textgreater} this leads back to the original question: what is this logic of openness that conditions Wikipedia’s politics?
12 – “While Gardner clearly wants to address the ‘gender gap’, she does so through a different kind of logic, whicbh is clearly privileged over gender per se. It is this logic that concerns me.”
Nate frames his analysis as a Latourian analysis of “kinds of statement” – lurking behind Latour are Kant and Foucault, and the notion of “transcendental” analysis. What are the conditions? What are the conditions of Wikipedia’s organizational form? What has to be fixed in order for these political movements to be possible?
Chapter 1. Open Politics
18 – The endpoint of Karl Popper’s theory: the closed society is based on “unchallengeable truths” – the open society is not: “The positive side of this political equation, the open society, is one where totalizing knowledge is necessarily impossible. Openness is necessary because no one can know for certain what the best course for society might be from the outset, and at the same time it is assumed that openness provides the best possible conditions for producing knowledge and therefore making better decisions.” – In a footnote, Nate nicely draws the link between this theory of society and Popper’s falsification theory.
18ff. – How the idea of ‘openness’ colonized the free software movement
23 – In 1998, the “Open Source Initiative” began as a deliberate alternative to Stallman’s more politicised “Free Software Movement” – open as an alternative to free …
24 – “Out of the FSM and the OSI emerge two competing mutations of liberalism.” Stallman’s “free” software “recogni[ses] that the creation of markets via the commodification of software actually reduces the capacities (or liberties) of individuals who use and modify it.” Raymond, a proponent of “open” software, laid the emphasis on the “production” rather than circulation of software: “Raymond’s writings on the ‘bazaar’ strongly parallel Hayek’s arguments about the ideal organization of society described above, but applied at the level of individual contributions to specific software projects.”
32 – “Open” is not a very useful word: “… I aim to demonstrate that not only is the open problematic in relation to contemporary software and network cultures, but that the concept contains a poverty that has existed in all its uses throughout history and that makes it unsuitable for political description.”
*33 – The dialectic of openness: “… the logic of openness actually gives rise to and is perfectly compatible with new forms of closure; indeed, that closure is inherent in Popper’s notion of openness. Moreover, I argue that there is something about openness, about the mobilization of the open and its conceptual allies, that actively works against making these closures visible.”
36 – Popper insists that open societies can change; this seems to imply that open societies are closed, and require further opening. “Thus, by invoking positive but ephemeral qualities, and a society that necessarily changes, Popper avoids the kinds of closure he identifies in totalitarian thought. At the same time, closure remains an inherent part of the open; it is what openness must continually respond to and work against—a continual threat among the ranks.”
*37 – The masking effect of “openness”: “Once a form of organization is labeled open, be it a state, movement, project, or party, it becomes difficult to account for the politics (closures) that emerge from within.”
Chapter 2. Sorting Collaboration Out
45 – Aha! Clay Shirky is the originator of this silly idea that Wikipedia articles are “processes” not “products”
46 - Wikipedia edits simultaneously change an article and Wikipedia: “… there is something in the contribution itself—whether in the actual act of contributing or the result—that communicates organization.”
49 – “Wikipedia is collaborative not because it has no hierarchies, but because it has policies that mediate between different and, indeed, often conflicting views, seemingly absorbing different perspectives into a single frame.”
*59 – An interesting asymmetry in the “Wikipedia Art” debate: “While there are, at least in the middle of the debate, equal voices in favor of keeping Wikipedia Art, the mode of argumentation is notably different. The excerpts show how ‘Deleters’ regularly refer to policies and guidelines and how they tend to be highly dismissive of the article/artwork. For their part, the ‘Keepers’ rarely refer to established policies and guidelines to support their claims. Their argumentative mode is far more deconstructive and explorative, often challenging or attempting to redefine existing rules.” – Eristische Dialektik of Wikipedia
65 – The Talk:Muhammad page reveals Wikipedia’s epistemological boundaries: “What these boxes and FAQ responses demonstrate is not that Wikipedia doesn’t discriminate between specific groups and forms of knowledge that help constitute them. Rather, … Wikipedia is defined through the systematic exclusion of certain forms of knowledge—and it does not discriminate between these discriminations!”
*67 – The methodological value of Talk Pages: “Any relatively established article entry, stripped of visible signs of conflict and controversy, must therefore be seen as the outcome of discussions and battles, of the competition of statements that takes place on discussion pages.”
78 – How frame analysis explains the problem for editors who couldn’t suppress images of Muhammad on Wikipedia: “They are wronged because their knowledge statements, and in particular a nonpictorial notion of Muhammad, cannot be articulated within the Wikipedia frame. These statements do not register; they have no agency or transformative capacity and thus neither do those who express them (within this particular frame).”
81 – The key concept of a “boundary statement,” which is a statement made at the boundary of two or more frames. It is a kind of strategic ambiguity.
*84 – A key point about the idea of “collaboration.” Does it still hold true nearly a decade later? “… discourses of collaboration are, like openness, depoliticized. This is perhaps not surprising, as we have had centuries to explore and feel the effects of government and market forms of organization, but very little time to experience and think about the political characteristics of open projects other than merely recognizing that they are different and seemingly better than previous forms of working together.”
3. The Governance of Forceful Statements: From Ad-Hocracy to Ex Corpore
92 – The intellectual history of “bureaucracy” and “ad-hocracy”: “Thus the transition from bureaucracy to ad-hocracy, to flat, ephemeral associations of highly mobile, creative ‘Associative Men’, committed to their ‘own career’, was part of a narrative of liberation, underpinned by the ineluctable motor of change.”
92 – This narrative influences how people understand Wikipedia: “I begin this chapter by drawing attention to the history of these two competing organizational forms because they continue to deeply inform how participants and observers understand the organization and governance of Wikipedia.”
*93 – There is a contradiction in the idea of ‘ad-hocracy’. Ad-hocracy is supposedly an ‘open’ form of organisation, which at the extreme is so open that it isn’t organised at all. But: “To pose the question of organization is always to ask how and not whether or not and, I might add, this how is never resolved by a mysterious ‘self’—as in self-governing, self-organizing, autonomous, and so forth—as if a form is completely disconnected from and unaffected by its surroundings …”
96-97 – “Thus, rather than taking seriously the question of how ad-hocracy organizes—how, for example, are large-scale, complex forms of organization possible despite transience?—Toffler focused on the problems of {\textbar} future shock.” – Nate makes a good point that the Blakean spectre of ad-hocracy is the precariat.
100 – The relationship between ‘statements’ and the text itself: “Of course, it isn’t the case that a reader of Wikipedia must school him- or herself on the five pillars before being able to make sense of the work. Not at all. Rather, the statement ‘Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia’ is itself distributed throughout the project.”
104ff – Case study of NPOV
*111-119 – Nate’s discussion of bots, esp. HagermanBot
115 – “Through Latour’s unique take on statements, it is possible to understand the rise of HagermanBot as the becoming-technical of the statement ‘sign and date your comments’.”
117 – A Weberian interpretation: “In relation to Weber’s apparatus, HagermanBot shows the birth of a new material implement; it is the becoming-technical of a previous guideline.”
118 – Hayles and Galloway: code is a kind of performative speech that is even more performative than typical examples (wedding celebration, proclamations etc.) {\textless}-- Their error, argues Nate, is that they “ascribe a performative strength to code before the fact.”
121 – How human users obtain “authority”: “The authority of a user lies instead in his or her ability to act in unison with the project’s framing statements and in the ability to mobilize the relevant rule or guideline whenever that user’s contributions are challenged.”
--{\textgreater} 122 – The nature of this authority: “I call this governing capacity of users instructuring agency. Another way of describing it is becoming a Wikipedian.”
This puts me in mind of Bourdieu. Wikipedians are virtuosi.
126 – “Forceful statements remain so because they are honored time and time again, from present to present; it is not their history that makes them forceful, but their continuing force that makes them historical.”

Introduction
2-3 – Eco defines six kind of perfect language. The relevant ones for Abstract Wikipedia are 2(b) and 2(c), which are kinds of artificial languages: “(b) perfection in terms of universality, such as the a priori international languages of the nineteenth century; (c) perfection in terms of practicality, if only presumed, such as the so-called polygraphies.”
4 – Eco excludes certain languages from his study. One of the exclusions would suggest his theory cannot be applied to Wikilambda: “5 formal languages whose use is limited to special scientific purposes, such as the languages of chemistry, algebra and logic …”
1 From Adam to Confusio Linguarum
A discussion of the myth of the Tower of Babel. Genesis is quite inconsistent on whether more than one language was spoken before the destruction of the tower.
*19 – “The story of the search for a perfect language is the story of a dream and of a series of failures.”
*19 – “We shall see that the dream of a perfect language has always been invoked as a solution to religious or political strife. … The history of the reasons why Europe thought that it needed a perfect language can thus tell us a good deal about the cultural history of that continent.”
24 – “Nevertheless, of all semiotic systems, nothing rivals language in its effability. This is why almost all projects for a perfect language start with natural, verbal languages as their model.”
4 The Ars Magna of Raymond Lull
54 – “Lull was the first European philosopher to write doctrinal works in the vulgar tongue. Some are even in popular verses, so as to reacher readeers who knew neither Latin nor Arabic: … His art was universal not merely in that it was designed to serve all peoples, but also in that it used letters and figures in a way (allegedly) comprehensible even to illiterates of any languages.”
55-56 – “In semiotic terms, we are in front of an expression-system (represented both by the symbols and by the syntactic rules establishing how n elements can be arranged t at a time – and where t can coincide with n), so that the arrangement of the expression-items can automatically reveal possible content-systems.”
5 The Monogenetic Hypothesis and the Mother Tongues
Early attempts to find the perfect language assumed that the original language spoken by people was perfect. So finding the perfect language meant finding the original one.
73 – Perfect vs. universality: “The distinction between a perfect language and a universal language was not sufficiently understood. It is one thing to search for a language capable of mirroring the true nature of objects; it is quite another to search for the language which everyone might, or ought to, speak. There is nothing that rules out that a language which is perfect might be accessible to only a few, while a language that is universal might also be imperfect.” – In this sense, Wikilambda tries to create a universal rather than a perfect language. They don’t make the claim that the Scheme creators did that their language represents computation in its true form.
8 Magic Language
190 – Universality and perfection again: “But it is perhaps nothing more than our ‘democratic’ illusion to imagine that perfection must imply universality.” {\textless}-- I don’t think the Wikilambda people make this mistake. They are quite willing to accept that their programming language, and their intended knowledge representation language, are imperfect.
9 Polygraphies
Basically Abstract Wikipedia and Wikifunctions form one of these.
203 – Some aspects of Early Modern Polygraphies foreshadow machine translation: “Becher’s and Schott’s systems appear totally impracticable for normal human use, but have been seen as tentative models for future practices of computer translation (cf. Heilmann 1963; De Mauro 1963). In fact, it is sufficient to think of Becher’s pseudo-ideograms as instructions for electronic circuits, prescribing to a machine which path to follow through the memory in order to retrieve a given linguistic term, and we have a procedure for word-for-word translation (with all the obvious inconveniences of such a merely mechanical program).” – Unfortunately Heilmann and De Mauro’s papers are in Italian…
204 – How abstract can a Polygraphy be? “There are two interesting features of this project [i.e. Kircher’s Novum inventum]. The first is that Kircher tried to merge a polygraphy with a sort of hieroglyphical lexicon, so that his language could be used (at least in the author’s intention) without translating it into a natural language. Seeing a ‘square + 4’, the readers should immediately understand that the named thing is an element, and seeing ‘chalice + 3’ they shoudl understand that one is referring to something to drink. The difficulty was due to the fact that, while both Kircher’s Polygraphia and Becher’s Character allow a translating operator (be it a human being or a machine) to work independently of any knowledge of the meaning of the linguistic items, the Novum inventum requires a non-mechanical and quasi-philosophical knowledge: in order to encode the word aqua as ‘square + 4’, one should previously know that it is the name of an element – information that the term of a natural language does not provide.” {\textless}-- this points to a general weakness in the Abstract Wikipedia design. The writers of the functions, and the articles, will need to know a lot more than they need to know to express themselves in their native language. The terms of ‘natural language’ don’t require the same level of explicit grammatical or metaphysical knowledge to use.
208 – “Borges’s conclusion was that there is no classification of the universe that is not arbitrary and conjectural. At the end of our panorama of philosophical languages, we shall see that, in the end, even Leibniz was forced to acknowledge this bitter conclusion.”
10 – A priori philosophical languages
220 – “… the search was now for a scientific or philosophical language, in which, by an unprecedented act of impositio nominum, expression and content would be locked in permanent accord.”
221 – Did Eco read SICP? “In order to design characters that directly denote notions … two conditions must be fulfilled: (1) the identification of primitive notions; (2) the organization of these primitives into a system which represents the model of the organization of content.” —{\textgreater} i.e. you first need to derive the basic categories of existence befor you can clothe them in a perfect language 
12 – John Wilkins
247 – Wilkins’ attempt to allow rhetoric/metaphor introduced imperfections into his philosophical language
249 – The central principle of Wilkins’s system: “its criterion of composition by atomic features, in order to ensure a complete isomorphism between expression and content.”
*259 – Key distinction between “search for a perfect language” and “search for ways to articulate all that natural languages permit us to say.”
13 – Francis Lodwick
265 – Comparison of Shank and Abelson (1977) with Lodwick
14 – From Leibniz to the Encyclopédie
287 – Leibniz’s formal languages don’t count as universal languages  Leibniz saw the impossibility of a universal languages of the kind proposed by Wilkins, and instead proposed universal languages of science that were suited to what he called “blind reasoning,” I.e. algebraic symbol manipulation. Eco: “… like all scientific languages, they are incapable of recording the entire universe, existing rather a set of *truths of reason*. Such languages do not qualify as a universal language because they fail to express – *truths of fact *.
*288 – Is this Eco’s first statement of the idea that the encyclopedia is a labyrinth? “Presented with the practice problem of organizing and encyclopedia and justifying the way that it divided its material, the system of scientific knowledge began to take on the appearance of a labyrinth, a network of forking and twisting paths that put paid to any notion that knowledge might be represented in a tree diagram of any sort.”
291 – The Idéologues: “Tracy understood that the prerequisite of all philosophical languages was the absolute and universal correspondence between signs and the ideas they represented. An examination, however, of the seventeenth-century English systems led him to the conclusion that ‘it is impossible that the same sign possess the same meaning for all who use it […]. We thus must give up the idea of perfection’.”
15 – Philosophic Language from the Enlightenment to Today
*311 – “Computer languages, like BASIC or Pascal, are, in fact, a priori languages. THey are not full languages because their syntax, though rigorous, is simplified and limited, and they remain parasitic on the natural languages which attach meanings to their empty symbols, which, for the most part, serve as logical connectors of the type if … then.” {\textless}-- Eco is obviously not familiar with the idea of programming as the description of an abstract machine. If you see programs as specifying a machine, then the languages are neither a priori nor “empty”.
316 – “It is only when we reconsider past projects revealed as utopian or as failures that we are apprised of the dangers and possibilities for failure for our allegedly new projects. The study of the deeds of our ancestors is thus more than an antiquarian pastime, it is an immunological precaution.”
16 – International Auxiliary Languages
325 – From practicality to perfectionism. The example of Esperanto: “… the majority of international languages represented themselves as nothing more than instruments of practical utility; Esperanto, by contrast, came increasingly to gather in its folds those religious and pacifist tensions which had been characteristics of many quests for a perfect language, at least until the end of the seventeenth century.”
*336 – “An IAL would certainly lack historic tradition behind it, with all the intertextual richness that this implies. But when the poets of medieval Sicilian courts wrote in a vernacular, when the Slavic bards sang The Song of Prince Igor and the Anglo-Saxon scop improvised Beowulf, their languages were just as young – yet still, in their own way, capable of absorbing the entire history of the preceding languages.” {\textless}-- If Abstract Wikipedia takes off, will its language become Concrete?
17 – Conclusion
339 – “This is more than the celebration of the particular ‘genius’ of each single language: the very sense of the myth of Babel has been turned upside down. The natural differentiation of languages has become a positive phenomenon underlying the allocation of peoples to their respective territories, the birth of nations, and the emergence of the sense of national identity.” {\textless}-- Modern celebration of diversity. Does AW embrace or reject this?
**344 – A Romantic justification for the confusio linguarum: “Genette has observed (1976: 161) how much the idea of confusio linguarum appears as a felix culpa in romantic authors such as Nodier: natural languages are perfect in so far as they are many, for the truth is many-sided and falsity consists in reducing this plurality into a single definite unity.”
346 – “In many of the most notable projects for mechanical translation, there exists a notion of a parameter language, which does share many of the charcteristics of the a priori languages. There must, it is argued, exist a tertium comparationis which might allow us to shift from an expression in language A to an expression in language B by deciding that both are equivalent to an expression of a metalanguage C. If such a tertium really existed, it would be a perfect language; if it did not exist, it would remain a mere postulate on which every translation ought to depend.” {\textless}-- AW’s representation language is by definition ‘perfect’

	abstract = {In the last two decades, the Linked Open Data paradigm has been experiencing exponential growth. Regularly, new datasets and ontologies are made publicly available, and novel projects are initiated to stimulate their continuous development and reuse, pushing more and more actors to adhere to the Semantic Web principles. The guidelines provided by the Semantic Web community allow to (i) homogeneously represent, (ii) uniquely identify, and (iii) uniformly reference any piece of information. However, the same standards do not allow defining and referencing the methods to exploit it: functions, procedures, algorithms, and code in general, are left out of this interconnected world. In this paper, we present our vision for a Web with Linked Open Code in which functions could be accessed and used as Linked Data, allowing logic harnessing the latter to be semantically described and FAIRly accessible. Hereafter, we describe the challenges presented by the implementation of our vision. We propose first insights on how to concretize it, and we provide a non-exhaustive list of communities that could benefit from such an ideal.},

14 – “Lambda calculus is a model for the applicative component of programming languages. It models all non-imperative constructs as applications of functions and specifies the semantics of such expressions by a set of axioms or rewrite rules.”
20 – The essence of continuation-passing style: “That is, in this continuation-passing programming style, a function ‘returns’ its result by ‘sending’ it to another function. This is the key idea.”
26 – Applicative or normal order? “This leads to the interesting conclusion that a practical lambda calculus interpreter cannot be purely call-by-name or call-by-value; it is necessary to have at least a little of each.” [call-by-name for if; call-by-value for primitives]
28 – How to implement a language: “The basic idea behind the implementation is think machine language. In particular, we must not use recursion in the implementation language to implement recursion in the language being interpreted. This is a crucial mistake which has screwed many language implementations (e.g. Micro-PLANNER [Sussman]).”

Why not use an existing NLG framework? (1) “By building the solution in a wiki, we can pivot. We can figure out we made a mistake and switch, without having to fork an existing NLG solution. The community can try out multiple directions, all built on a single common framework, i.e. Wikifunctions. This allows for (1) familiarity with the framework to carry over and (2) substantial portions of work to be reused, as directions evolve.”
Why not use an existing NLG framework? (2) “Also, by reducing Abstract Wikipedia to a framework that is strictly aimed at natural language generation, we would not be able to produce other kinds of output: we wouldn’t be able to share functions such as calculating the age of a person based on the date of birth, or geosohapes to list all animals that live in an administrative area, or even to create something as simple as tables or charts, which are all very useful for an encyclopedia and form part of the Wikimedia movement’s vision for Wikifunctions, distinct from the plans around Abstract Wikipedia.”
**Abstract Wikipedia’s postcolonial philosophy: “A solution designed by a small group of Westerners is likely to produce a system that replicates the trends of an imperialist English-focused Western-thinking industry. Existing tools tell a one-voice story; they are built by the same people (in a socio-cultural sense) and produce the same outcome, which is crafted to the needs of their creators (or by the limits of their understanding). Tools are then used to build tools, which will be again used to build more tools; step by step, every level of architectural decision-making limits more and more the space that can be benefitted by these efforts.”
The opposite of Wikifunctions = Sauron: “… a “One Ring” solution as well …” {\textless}-- how often does this metaphor occur?
**Why Wikifunctions has to come before the abstract language of Abstract Wikipedia: “It assumes the existence of a single authority in whom is vested the power to design “the data.” Unfortunately, as every existing NLG system demonstrates, no single authority possesses sufficient emotional intelligence, breadth of linguistic knowledge, or subtlety of cultural awareness to create a system whose functioning is equally sound for all humans who interact with it.” (Underlining by MF)
*Wikipedia’s democratic mission: “Tech has enshrined as a term of art the word “user,” and with it presumptions about subjectivity. Under this assumption, a small number of technologists occupy subject position; they produce software which is to be passively consumed by users. … / … Abstract Wikipedia must eschew this assumption and adopt a radically inclusive model. This means that every step of the process of natural language generation should be visible, defeasible, and subject to participation by the broader community.”
**The Marxism of Wikifunctions: Existing NLG frameworks might contribute to “minor questions like algorithms and architecture, not to foundational assumptions about relationships of production.”
Why functional programming is the right paradigm: “Functional programming is a different way of thinking and it generally poses a challenge for a mind that has already absorbed the imperative programming paradigm. However, functional programming is closer to other areas of study, such as mathematics and any disciplines that require probabilistic or scientific computation. For people who have no prior relationship with programming, a functional paradigm might be as intuitive as an imperative one, if not more so.” {\textless}-- It is interesting to note that most of the famous languages developed for children and the public, e.g. Logo, Scratch, Smalltalk, Processing, BASIC, have been either imperative and/or object-oriented. Python is possibly an exception, and Racket – look up Annette Vee.
Is Wikifunctions a programming language?

This extra composition layer constitutes an entirely distinct language on its own

This is correct. Here we briefly point out that an alternative means of creating compositions is available; we shall have recourse to this example on several occasions, as it can remedy many of the pain points and deficiencies of the current implementation.
cf. What Wikifunctions is Not -{\textgreater} where they say it is not a programming language!
Are wikifunctions pure, or not? “Wikifunctions does not currently enforce pure functionality.” … “… it’s more likely that Wikifunctions will, in a controlled way, at some point rescind the claim that it is a pure-functional language.”
The language that does not speak: “It is a non-goal to insist a priori on a single standard. It is a goal to provide the tools for contributors to find standards that work.” {\textless}-- Wikifunctions itself says nothing. It is space – cf. Eco on the content-continuum and the expression-continuum
Why WF must support multiple languages: “This support is an important part of Wikifunctions’s other purposes, such as serving as an algorithmic reference tool.” {\textless}-- but Wikifunctions is not an encyclopaedia of algorithms…
**A key idea that has recurred in this document: coding literacy is its own thing, that does not draw in any way on other kinds of literacy. “A contributor who is already a strong coder should have no trouble adapting to a slightly different paradigm; a contributor who is not yet a strong coder will presumably not have a “familiar” environment.” {\textless}-- it doesn’t matter what the development environment is like, because the platform’s novice developers won’t have any expectations about what development environments are like. – Again, this contradicts one of the most familiar aspects of coding literacy, the attempt to find metaphors in existing writing.
Simplicity of the language: “… composition is just an abstract syntax tree” {\textless}-- is this claim true? How do you define an AST?
How do you measure the speed of Wikipedia? In response to the critique that the orchestrator will be too slow, the Abstractians write: “As is easy to see, the current system can take months and years, or even fail, to propagate changes in the world: an update to the Romanian Wikipedia documenting a change in the world can take a long time to propagate to the Japanese Wikipedia, since it is a process that involves people reading and editing articles. If the Abstract Wikipedia solution leads to a solution that even takes a day or two, it would still vastly outperform the current system.” As in, it will take a day or two to render one article???
**The Abstract Wikipedia Philosophy: Freedom, Flexibility, and Openness
“Instead we have opted to plan for and developing an environment where we can, together with the community,


embrace a diversity of programming languages (which also provides us with more robustness in the system overall)


allow for implementations and contributions in a diversity of natural languages, and not only in a single natural language


experiment and try out different approaches to natural language generation, with the flexibility to pivot and fallback to a powerful, unconstrained environment


organically grow the set of constructors, not only in the beginning of the project, but also throughout, and keep extending it without being constrained by an early, possibly preliminary set of selected constructors


“We understand that this freedom, flexibility, and openness comes with a higher initial development cost, but it ultimately allows for a substantial co-creation with the community.”

Observations on semantics
The orchestrator service provides the “composition” language of Wikifunctions.
Key evaluation methods in the orchestrator:


resolve(), which does “small-step” evaluations, i.e. individual substitutions


execute(), which does “big-step” evaluations, i.e full simplification/application


In this semantics paper, the Google Fellows are obsessed with “confluence.” What is that?
At the time of writing, Wikifunctions was call-by-need – lazy evaluation with automatic caching of evaluations.
They explain confluence. It’s a bit of a “who cares?” Confluence is a property of an language where the evaluation order doesn’t matter. What kind of stupid property is that?
The writers of this paper seem to prefer applicative order (eager) to normal order (lazy). It’s not clear why. It’s also not clear why they think confluence is a desirable property. You get the sense that a bunch of “engineers” from Google took exception to the hacky culture of the Wikifunctions team.
Recommendations
The author doesn’t like Javascript as the implementation language. They want a statically typed language.
*They also make a point worth chasing up: that Javascript lacks “builtin sum/union types,” which makes it “difficult to represent ASTs.” {\textless}-- Is this true? I thought JavaScript had a LISPy core that would make it easy to traverse a tree…

“The very ubiquity of computers might make us reflect, and ask how it is that one device can fulfil such a dazzling array of roles. The answer, of course, is that the computer is a universal device, in a sense made precise by the British mathematician Alan Turing in the 1930s.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 1)
“Computers possess this flexibility because of the great range of programs that can be run on them” (Priestley, 2011, p. 1) Programmability ={\textgreater} universality
“To reinterpret Turing’s insight in modern terminology we might say that programs are descriptions of information-processing machines.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 2) Program = description of a machine
“Understanding this relationship between programs and machines opens up the possibility of widening the scope of the history of programming to include episodes involving the construction and use of certain information-processing machines that predate the invention of the electronic digital computer. This in turn suggests a wider perspective, which sees the history of programming as part of the broader field of the history of machinery. Ideas about programming have evolved in parallel with developments in machinery, and in particular the development of machines meant to carry out programmed instructions.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 2) Programming predates the computer
“Universal Languages” (Priestley, 2011, p. 5)
“One particularly comprehensive and ambitious proposal was the Essay Towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language written by John Wilkins, Bishop of Chester and one of the founders of the Royal Society.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 5)
“laws of combination” (Priestley, 2011, p. 13) Did Peacock originate this phrase? Cf. SICP
“laws of combination” (Priestley, 2011, p. 13)
“Babbage’s machines, and in particular the Analytical Engine, are often portrayed as isolated precursors of the modern computer, and Babbage as an anachronistic genius who had the misfortune to live at a time when technology was insufficiently developed to enable him to fully implement his vision. When viewed in context, however, a rather different picture emerges. Babbage engaged whole-heartedly with the scientific, industrial and even political life of his time, and this chapter describes how his calculating engines can be seen in a fuller historical context.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 17)
“He now referred to this technique as enabling the machine to “eat its own tail”” (Priestley, 2011, p. 31) recursion in the Analytical Engine?
“Lovelace characterized this situation by drawing a distinction between the “mechanical” and “mathematical” views of the engine. The mathematical view was that of someone “taking for granted that mechanism is able to perform certain processes, but without attempting to explain how”, and describing instead “the manner in which analytical laws can be so arranged and combined as to bring every branch of that vast subject within the grasp of the assumed powers of mechanism”.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 36) Did Lovelace invent computer science
“Lovelace wrote that the engine may be described as being the material expression of any indefinite function of any degree of generality and complexity,” (Priestley, 2011, p. 40) Is this equivalent to Turing-completeness?
“the science of operations” (Priestley, 2011, p. 42) Lovelace the apparent originator of this phrase
“Neither Babbage nor Lovelace was able, however, to cleanly separate the operations required by this new science from the familiar operations of analysis.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 51) Neither Babbage nor Lovelace quite distinguished programming as a distinctive activity from mathematical analysis – though they did grapple with the idea
“Large technological systems, such as railway and telegraph networks, and commercial concerns such as insurance companies required increasingly complex systems to manage their businesses, and towards the end of the nineteenth century they began to be automated, using the punched card technology. The first major application of this approach was in the 1890 census in the United States, which made use of the tabulating machines developed by Herman Hollerith.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 52)
“Once punched, the cards were counted by tabulators. An operator would insert a card into a press, and lower an array of metal pins onto the card. The pins would pass through any holes punched in the card, making contact with a small cup of mercury underneath the cards. This completed a circuit, generating an electrical impulse which could be communicated to one or more counters” (Priestley, 2011, p. 54) Hollerith's punched card machines for the 1890s US census were electromechanical
“One significant innovation of the system was the mechanization of data, the representation of information in a permanent, machine-readable form.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 55)
“Otto Schäffler” (Priestley, 2011, p. 58) made tabulators programmable by the addition of a plugboard
“3.4 Comrie and the Mechanization of Scientific Calculation” (Priestley, 2011, p. 59) Could this be an appropriate origin-point for 'computational science'?
“One might feel a reluctance to describe the activities described in this chapter as programming. The semi-automated computations carried out on calculators and Hollerith machinery sit somewhere in the middle of a spectrum which has at one end a numerical analyst devising a new pen-and-paper algorithm, and at the other the programming, in the modern sense, of a fully automated machine such as the Analytical Engine.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 64) Where is the border of programming?
“The overall situation is that between 1885 and 1935 the amount of mechanical computation being carried out in the world dramatically increased. This increase was at first most noticeable in the commercial world, where both calculators and Hollerith machinery were increasingly used, but this usage later spread to scientific calculation as well, thanks to the efforts of Comrie and Eckert in particular.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 64) *First era of computing – 1885-1935, the age of mechanical computing
“On the theoretical side, mathematical logicians constructed various accounts of the notion of mechanical computation, or ‘effective computability’. Different, but provably equivalent, accounts of this notion were published in 1936 by Stephen Kleene, Alonzo Church, Emil Post and Alan Turing.1 At the same time, logicians also developed a new theory of formal languages, one which made concrete the idea of a notation or language that could be processed ‘mechanically’, and so by extension read and interpreted by actual machines.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 65) Intellectual breakthroughs of the 1930s – 'computability' \& formal languages
“Post and Turing abstracted two essential features from the familiar activity of human computation: an external medium on which the data involved in the computation could be recorded, and a representation of the instructions that the computer was following.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 74)
“Some of the resemblances between Turing’s notation and subsequent languages are indeed striking, but focusing on these leads to a rather unhistorical interpretation of Turing’s work. This section describes the machine table notation in the context of the other notations for computability defined in the 1930s, and highlights the continuities between Turing’s work and that of his contemporaries.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 75)
“Turing’s 1936 paper has often been described as foundational to the development of computing and the computer science that soon followed. This chapter has taken a different perspective, however, emphasizing instead the close relationship between Turing’s ideas and contemporary work in mathematical logic. This is not an attempt to deny Turing’s originality, however, but rather to relocate it in the details of his mathematical practice.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 94)
“Turing wanted to take seriously the idea of computation by machines as a basis for an analysis of computability, and his problem was how to bridge the gap between the existing discipline of mathematical logic and the more concrete world of machines. He achieved this by the introduction of the machine table notation, which provided textual equivalents of potentially physical machines. By treating machine tables as texts in a formal language, it became possible for Turing to apply the well-developed resources of formal logic to the study of machines.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 94)
“However, Turing’s work of 1936 can be understood as extending the domain of mathematical logic by introducing the machine table notation as a formal, textual representation of commands. Further, it has been argued that Turing applied and generalized existing work in logic, particularly that of Gödel, to give a formalization of the semantic notion of obeying a command, namely the universal machine.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 96) *Turing's original contribution: the invention of imperative logic, the logic of command
“A major consumer of this new computing power was the Ordnance Department of the US Army, which required the production of firing tables for the many new weapons developed at its Proving Grounds at Aberdeen, Maryland, during the war.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 116) military-industrial complex of early automatic calculation
“However, it does not appear that prior knowledge of Babbage’s work was in fact influential in the design of the ASCC and other machines.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 116) Early C20th computer builders were inspired but Babbage in only a general way
“This analogy makes it clear what the scope of the new machines was. Control of the manual computation was the task of the human computer, responsible for interpreting the formulae provided and making appropriate decisions at key points about how to proceed. In the design of the machine, however, control is built in: four of the seven components shown by Williams have the word ‘control’ in their titles. Furthermore, the human capacity to make decisions is replaced by a new unit, called the discriminator, which is fully integrated into the machine structure.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 119) *the key element of automatic calculators was “control”
“These examples show how these machines, far from representing a revolutionary break, represented an evolutionary step in computing practice. Current practices were inscribed in their very design, and in application they added to the available computational power, but without changing its nature.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 120) Early automatic calculators were essentially mechanical replicas of human computers
“This idea of self-modifying code turned out to be highly significant. In the Draft Report it was introduced rather tentatively, however, and the general idea of treating orders as data was only applied for the specific purpose of modifying the memory address to which a particular order referred.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 139) A crucial, and initially unexpected feature of EDVAC – using the same store for program and data allowed the program to be treated as data
“It seems plausible to suggest, then, that whereas von Neumann set out to design an automatic calculator, Turing was more concerned to produce a practical version of the universal machine which could, with the addition of some specialized circuitry, be used as a high-speed calculator.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 144)
“In Turing’s 1936 paper, the word ‘universal’ is applied to a specific machine U which is able to simulate the behaviour of any other machine, given a suitable representation of the table of the machine to be simulated. U is only universal relative to the class of machines described in the paper, however. Presented with a description of a configuration of the ENIAC, say, it would be unable to simulate the resulting computation: for this purpose, a different universal machine would have to be defined.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 147)
“A very natural account semantic account of programs takes as its starting point the idea that the meaning of a program text, or sequence of instructions, is in some way connected to the computation that it expresses or, in more concrete terms, the different sequences of operations that a computer might carry out while executing the program. In the course of their exploration of the possibilities of programming stored-program machines, Goldstine and von Neumann came up with a sophisticated account of this notion of semantics, together with a flow diagram notation which expressed such meanings and could be used as a way to develop programs.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 178) early approach to semantics of code ={\textgreater} code expresses a computation
“These differences meant that a semantic account of programs was going to differ in some ways from the account given for predicate logic. A semantic account of logic is typically presented as a mapping from a set of stable, syntactic expressions to some domain of meanings. The possibility of instruction modification, however, means that the situation with programs is more complex.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 178)
“One possible answer is that it was the style of the definition that gave rise to its success. Although a number of writers had perceived a general similarity between logic and programming, this was the first time that techniques from formal logic had been applied to a relatively mundane task like syntax definition.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 199) FORTRAN was defined precisely using tools from logic – this probably contributed to its influence/success
“Even more than its predecessor, Algol 60 was presented as a language for communication, rather than as a notation to control the behaviour of computers: the report stated that “[t]he purpose of the algorithmic language is to describe computational processes”.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 205) Key aspect of ALGOL – A communication medium for the computing community
“This approach was believed to promise a number of benefits. Firstly, there was a belief that the Algol approach was in principle wrong, and that there would be a need for many different problem-oriented languages, each tailored to the needs of programmers in particular application areas. Secondly, it was anticipated that the implementation of a new problem-oriented language would require only a POL-toUNCOL translator to be written, and that this would be much easier that writing a full compiler for every machine that the POL ran on.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 206) UNCOL language: creators distinguished between 'problem-oriented languages' (e.g. ALGOL) and 'computer-oriented languages' (e.g. Assembly). They proposed a universal computer-oriented language. I suppose this is the forerunner of 'intermediate representations' in modern compilers like LLVM
“For example, in 1959 Puyen and Vauquis wrote of the emerging Algol definition in an manner very reminiscent of Carnap’s discussions of logical syntax:” (Priestley, 2011, p. 207) ALGOL pioneers used similar 'elements' and 'means of combination' idea presented by Sussman \& Abelson
“It was argued above that one major innovation of Fortran was to give a recursive definition of the structure of arithmetical expressions. The Algol 60 report gave a similar account of statements, giving them the same combination of simplicity and potential complexity as mathematical formulae.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 213) Key innovation of ALGOL 60 was the recursive definition of statements – allowing for much more complex program code
“A formally defined programming language, therefore, should therefore define in purely structural terms what is a program and what is not.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 213) The logical semantics of a programming language
“In the Algol 58 report, the major syntactic categories of expressions, statements and declarations had been distinguished by their differing semantic roles.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 214) Distinction between different kinds of 'utterance' in a programming language
“Thus Algol 60 defined two interpretation of the process of passing parameters to subroutines, call by value and call by name. It is a striking coincidence that these correspond closely to the two interpretations traditionally given to quantifiers in logic, with call by value resembling the traditional ‘objectual’ interpretation and call by name the ‘substitutional’ interpretation (re)introduced to the logical literature by Ruth Barcan Marcus,89 but there appears to be no evidence of mutual influence between this work and thee details of the parameter passing mechanisms of Algol.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 217) Calling by name and value (coincidentally) matches two contrasting modes of substitution in predicate logic
“In Sect. 8.6 it was argued that Algol was explicitly defined as a formal language, in the same way as logical notations, and Sect. 8.7 described the way in which specific features of Algol were influenced by logic. This is not the only story that could be told, of course. Some languages, and in particular those intended for data processing applications, such as FLOW-MATIC and Cobol, emphasized instead the extent to which programming notations could be made to resemble natural languages, as a way of making them easier to read, and also, perhaps, to write. A third approach, originating in the needs of artificial intelligence, also made use of the resources of mathematical logic, but in a very different way from Algol.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 224) There are different ways of thinking about the formal and linguistic aspects of programming languages
“In 1965 Dijkstra wrote a paper which considered how a “lone programmer” could have confidence that the results of a program were in fact those intended.54 In some cases, the results of a program can be directly checked, but in other cases this is not feasible. Dijkstra considered the example of a program which tests the primality of large integers. If such a program generates purported factors for a large integer, this result can be checked by direct calculation. If on the other hand the program reports that there are no factors, the programmer has to decide how much credence to put in this report. In its general form, this is an epistemological question. Many programs function as potential sources of knowledge, whether concerning the primality of integers or the size of a gas bill, and Dijkstra asked under what circumstances we can place confidence in the knowledge generated by such programs, and what we can do to increase this degree of confidence.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 238) Epistemology of computing
“Dijkstra made the same point as follows: “we should do . . . our utmost to shorten the conceptual gap between the static program and the dynamic process, to make the correspondence between the program (spread out in text space) and the process (spread out in time) as trivial as possible”.62” (Priestley, 2011, p. 241) *aim of programming language design: to allow the programmer to clearly express the behaviour of the peogram
“As Charles Bachman, a database researcher, put it in 1973, the move from files to database could be viewed as a kind of Copernican revolution, challenging the perceived centrality of programs and proposing a new model of computation in which programs were viewed as satellites of a central data repository.93” (Priestley, 2011, p. 250)
“in various ways Smalltalk marks a limit to the influence of logic on programming language design.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 277) Smalltalk was basically the end of the 'Algol research programme'
“Simulation languages, then, were not simply alternatives to algorithmic languages like Algol, but had an entirely different goal: their purpose was to describe not just computations, but whole systems.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 279) Algol -{\textgreater} algorithmsSimula -{\textgreater} systems
“This extension changed the lifetimes of blocks: in Algol, blocks could be nested, with the consequence that data defined in the inner block could only be maintained as long as the outer block was still in existence. For simulation programs, however, the lifetime of data in the program was unpredictable and depended on the events being simulated. This made the Algol discipline too restrictive, and Simula therefore generalized the notion of a block so that “a process may remain and operate after [the block in which it was created] is out of the system, i.e. the life spans of different processes may overlap each other in any way”” (Priestley, 2011, p. 280) The crucial difference between Simula and base Algol – persistent state
“Because of the nature of simulation systems, languages like Simula were naturally described as providing the ability to model certain aspects of the real world.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 281)
“In a terminological change which was influenced by Hoare’s work on record classes, the ‘activities’ and ‘processes’ of Simula were renamed as classes and objects.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 282) Simula 67 introduced the 'class'/'object' vocabulary
“Furthermore, a different model of processing is involved: when an operation is invoked on an object, the object updates itself in situ; with an abstract data type, by contrast, a data value is passed as an argument to a function and an updated value is returned.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 288) Again, key difference between the new 'objects' and the earlier 'data types' – persistent state
“Another important difference was connected with the idea of protection: abstract data types provided a barrier which allowed programmers to manipulate data only by means of the provided operations. Simula 67, by contrast, allowed programs to have unrestricted access to the attributes of objects, and therefore did not support a crucial part of the notion of abstraction.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 288) protection another key aspect
“It was thought of as a “metamedium, whose content would be a wide range of already-existing and not-yet-invented media”.31” (Priestley, 2011, p. 289)
“Crucially, Smalltalk was intended to be not only the language in which the system was coded, but also a medium through which users would work with the system. Programming was not thought of as the production of code by following a process modelled on engineering process, but as an ongoing interaction with a complex and reactive system.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 289) *Code as interaction (as communication?)
“This is a striking example of the effect that a different set of priorities could have on programming style. In scientific programming, non-terminating loops were often taken to be a severe error: Strachey had declared that programs which contained them were meaningless, and methods for proving that a program terminated when expected were intensively investigated. In Smalltalk, however, unbounded iteration simply provided for an open-ending and ongoing interaction between the user and the computer, and non-termination was not seen as a problem:” (Priestley, 2011, p. 291)
“In terms of their effect on the system, however, textual and non-textual interactions were semantically equivalent, both specifying that a message be sent to an object.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 293) Smalltalk was un-Algolish because you could 'code' without using text
“Because Smalltalk was thought of not just as a programming language but more generally as a programming system, there was no clear notion of what a separate Smalltalk program might consist of.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 294)
“The designers of Smalltalk saw themselves as adopting the more radical approach of taking the notion of simulation expressed in Simula as the fundamental principle of computation.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 295) Algol: a system for defining algorithms that could then be applied to dataSmalltalk: a system for creating simulations of the world
*“It should be noted in passing that many aspects of the Smalltalk style were also characteristic of Lisp programming environments, though in a less pronounced form. The contrast between this open, exploratory style of programming, and the more rigid, formal style of the Algol tradition is a striking feature of the history of programming, one which is still in evidence to the present day.” (Priestley, 2011, p. 296) Smalltalk was used for exploratory programming – not really an Algol speciality – makes it a bit like LISP {\textless}-- Wikifunctions also part of this ‘open, exploratory’ approach to programming; also, like Smalltalk, a programming system rather than a programming language

	annote = {Priestley describes the development of modern, high-level programming languages. He begins in the nineteenth century, explaining how Babbage, Lovelace, Turing and other logicians attempted to describe the process of computation using formal notation. He then describes the development of machine languages for early ‘automatic calculators’, before briefly considering FORTRAN, LISP and COBOL. The book culminates with his discussion of the ‘Algol research programme’. 
According to Priestley, the conventional view that programming grew out of logic and algebra is false. In fact, programming languages initially developed in the practical context of trying to get early computers to work. The Algol research programme was an attempt to inject logic back into programming. In this respect, it largely succeeded, and logical concepts were crucial to the development of structured programming and later of object-oriented programming.
It would be nice to read a sequel to this book, which covered the development of functional programming in the 1980s and 90s. In some ways, functional programming seems to be a continuation of the ‘Algol research programme’, which Priestley claims came to an end with the development of Smalltalk.

“Certainly, not everyone who reads code, as in this case with the employers, even shares the goal of realizing that particular software process. This is crucial because much writing about code, from textbooks to style guides, suggests that code is being written primarily to create a certain effect through software, which neglects the use of code in training exercises and artistic explorations, just to name two examples in which the computer program was not written to execute a solution to a problem” (Marino, 2020, p. 8)“To focus on the code of this sign, its competencies and whether it would compile, rather than its meaning in context, is to demonstrate the way the centrality of the machine, the need to make code utterances legible to the unambiguous processing of the compiler, takes precedence from and in turn deprecates other explorations of meaning. A” (Marino, 2020, p. 12)“The goal of this comparison is not to call one coding act better than another but to demonstrate the ways meaning in code arises from its context, not independent of its functionality but growing out of its functionality.” (Marino, 2020, p. 16)“I argue that computer source code since its inception has been a means of communication (and hence ideological), but that we are only beginning to discover the methods of explaining that ideology or, more broadly, that meaning.” (Marino, 2020, p. 17)“But how does one read code? In my search for answers, I found a few scholars who wrote about the ontology of computer source code. Kittler (1992) had written a bit. Lawrence Lessig (2006)” (Marino, 2020, p. 18)“had approached code in a broader sense, bringing ideas from the legal world. Code had also been taken up by a handful of other scholars, specifically Adrian MacKenzie (2005, 2006), Florian Cramer (2005), Loss Pequeño Glazier (2006), Alan Liu (2004), and Alexander Galloway (2004). Their gestures were powerful opening movements into the realm of code, but they did not include many examples of actually interpreting the code. If code is, as these critics were suggesting, a unique semiotic realm, what could one say about any one passage of code?” (Marino, 2020, p. 19)“We had to get past the understanding of code as meaningless math (also, as it turns out, a false conception) and instead approach it as a culturally situated sign system full of denotations and connotations, rendered meaningful by its many and diverse readers, both human and machinic.” (Marino, 2020, p. 19)“To read and interpret code does not necessarily mean to discover secret content or to uncover its unconscious bias or even to reveal unusual functioning. Instead, to read code critically is to explore the significance of the specific symbolic structures of the code and their effects over time if and when they are executed (after being compiled, if necessary), within the cultural moment of their development and deployment” (Marino, 2020, p. 23)“not my intention to limit these readings or even perform them here but instead to demonstrate how much more fruitful a reading can be when performed on realworld code, not merely hypothetical code or pseudocode. T” (Marino, 2020, p. 27) This is an interesting point – in programming education, there is so much pseudo code. What do you see when you look at real code?“Some of these lenses focus on aspects of identity, others on issues of power, and still others on ontology and signification. T” (Marino, 2020, p. 29) Does this cover the field of literary interpretation?“Code should be read, and read with the kind of care and attention to detail that a programmer must use when debugging it, further augmented by the many reading strategies and heuristics that scholars have been developing for the interpretation of other kinds of texts and supplemented by new kinds of reading practices that speak more directly to the nature of code in its contexts.” (Marino, 2020, p. 31)“In programming, these cultures emerge around coding paradigms, languages, roles, and specializations, but also from an ethos or ideology, such as the FOSS community (see Coleman 2012).” (Marino, 2020, p. 31) How to divide up coding cultures. Programming paradigms is one.“Critical code studies names the applications of hermeneutics to the interpretation of the extrafunctional significance of computer source code.” (Marino, 2020, p. 33) Can function be separate from meaning? Is this the old modern divide of Latour back again? Or a slip of the pen.“extrafunctional significance,” (Marino, 2020, p. 34) The target of CCS“On the one hand, FLOW-MATIC demonstrates the way legibility and writability in programming adhere to different criteria than natural spoken and written languages. On the other hand, FLOW-MATIC offers a clear sign of how the linguistic culture of what some have called global English/es were built into programming languages.” (Marino, 2020, p. 35)

“Even when aesthetics intervenes, it comes in the form of calls for stylistic clarity for more efficient modification and development, though the subjective notions of “beauty” and “elegance” in code offer an opportunity for future conversations across the disciplines.” (Marino, 2020, p. 38) *Current state of code aesthetics – basically subordinated to engineering aims; "subjective" and empirical in orientation“I would like to propose that we no longer speak of the code as a text in metaphorical terms, but that we begin to analyze and explicate code as a text, as a sign system with its own rhetoric, as semiotic communication that possesses significance in excess of its functional utility” (Marino, 2020, p. 39) Code's meaning as "excess" ... is the concept of transgression lurking about?“Whereas a computer scientist or programmer will focus primarily on how code functions or how it makes use of limited resources, critical code studies analyzes the extrafunctional significance of the code. Extra here means not outside of or in addition to but instead growing out of. The meaning of code is ambiguous because it is social, even while it is unambiguous because it is technological. The programmers’ expertise derives not solely from scientific knowledge but also from experience in the culture of programming.” (Marino, 2020, p. 40)“Specific coding ideologies, such as open-source programming, also will be important, though CCS holds that language, as Gunther Kress and Robert Hodge (1979) have asserted, is already ideology.” (Marino, 2020, p. 40)“CCS will look broadly at choices in paradigms (such as object-oriented approaches) and closely at specific lines of code, their constraints, and their effects.” (Marino, 2020, p. 40) *paradigms as units of analysis“connotation” (Marino, 2020, p. 40)“However, the goal of critical code studies is not to aid programmers to write more readable code, though that may be an indirect effect, but instead to develop rich methods of reading that code.” (Marino, 2020, p. 41)“By contrast, interpretation in a humanities context is less about mapping a one-to-one correspondence and more about identifying connections and resonances between signs and referents, as well as identifying disconnections and slippages along with the forces that shape or distort meaning.” (Marino, 2020, p. 42)“First, assuming it is created by a human and not other software, the programmer reads the code even while compositing it. Second, other programmers may read the code. Third, nonprogrammers, such as project managers or audiences of interdisciplinary conferences, may read the code. The code also may end up in the hands of hackers. Even the machine on which the computer runs may prove to be multiple audiences, as parts of the code are passed to other processes and other parts of the machine. Furthermore, there already are many sites of conversation about code.” (Marino, 2020, p. 45) code's many readers/audiences --{\textgreater} cf. Grace Hopper's comment in Knuth's history of early PLs, where she says that she tried to include mathematical notation in her languages, but the executives felt alienated. That may come up in the Flow-Matic chapter of this book“Computer code is not some undiscovered continent. Nor is it some magical sign system. It is a realm of creativity and production that has been around for more than half a century. It would be a terrible mistake to enter discussions about code by offering to interpret it for the very programmers who have been slogging away in it for so long. To do so would be to commit the offense of techno-Orientalism.” (Marino, 2020, p. 47) *haha! risk of "techno-Orientalism"“Wendy Chun has expressed concerns about the tendency to treat source code as something essential, as the heart of the program, even conflating it with the executable code that the source code is compiled into. Such a search risks engaging in what she calls a kind of “sourcery” (Chun 2011).” (Marino, 2020, p. 47)“For example, Patrick LeMieux (2015) has read the assembly language of Cory Arcangel’s Super Mario Clouds to study the mechanisms of that work.” (Marino, 2020, p. 47)“The first practice is the acknowledgement that code is an entry point to an investigation rather than an end in itself.” (Marino, 2020, p. 48)“Kirschenbaum proposed reading code within its version control setting.” (Marino, 2020, p. 48)“Loss Pequeño Glazier’s (2006) article in Leonardo Electronic Almanac, “Code as Language,” argues that “if language is defined as written symbols organized into combinations and patterns to express and communicate thoughts and feelings—language that executes—then coding is language.”” (Marino, 2020, p. 49)“In “The Aesthetics of Generative Code,” Geoff Cox, Alex McLean, and Adrian Ward (2000) compare code to poetry as they develop some techniques for interpreting it. In their words, “Evidently, code works like poetry in that it plays with structures of language itself, as well as our corresponding perceptions.”” (Marino, 2020, p. 49)“That said, if the writers publish their commentary, as in Terry Winograd’s SHRDLU, to name just one example, that commentary becomes a paratext that shapes the meaning of the code.” (Marino, 2020, p. 51)“Because of that consistency and because that consistency is the necessary condition for software production and distribution, making and reading code relies on an ability to predict, produce, and test the states of the systems over the duration of the implementation (compiling, processing, and execution). Because of the complexity of these systems, full understanding of the code requires an understanding of the code in action.” (Marino, 2020, p. 52)“Interpretation requires reading an object in its (post)human context through a particular critical lens. This context involves human machines operating in actornetworks.8” (Marino, 2020, p. 52)

“One way of reading code involves simulating its operations in one’s mind, tracing the effects of changing conditions on the state of the software as it executes.” (Marino, 2020, p. 78) code represents changes to state – is this informally similar to Strachey's denotational semantics?“This artwork inverts that narrative by marshaling empathy for the border crosser who has already passed into the United States but who is about to die of thirst.” (Marino, 2020, p. 78) The code effectively narrates the plight of the border crosser in the desert“the source code of the Transborder Immigrant Tool represents an example of code written to be interpreted by CCS scholars” (Marino, 2020, p. 79)“In this work, poetry becomes code when it becomes instructions for procedures; code becomes poetry when it disrupts and resituates overdetermined signifiers, when it creates use cases of human suffering and assistance.” (Marino, 2020, p. 83) *One idea of "code poetry"“Following the subversive approach of the larger project, Carroll’s poetry engages with the aesthetics of instructions, of survival knowledge, derived from folk wisdom more than the episteme of scientific knowledge epitomized by the mobile phone that delivers the app.” (Marino, 2020, p. 83)“The program is literally the codification of the folk knowledge as procedure and objects, threads and events.” (Marino, 2020, p. 84)“To read the poetry of TBT is to imagine a traveler in an hour of need receiving justin-time guidance and sustenance.” (Marino, 2020, p. 87) Again, the idea of the code as a user-story“Andrea diSessa (2001), in her book Changing Minds: Computers, Learning, and Literacy, offers the notion of material intelligence to substitute for literacy, meaning “intelligence achieved cooperatively with external materials” (5).” (Marino, 2020, p. 88) Another computer literacy book“In other words, in this piece that is about wayfinding and sustenance, the code is crafted with an eye toward sustainability and navigability, helping readers to find their way though it.” (Marino, 2020, p. 88) verbose and readable Java is an oddly appropriate language for this project“By contrast, the code in this file seems authorless yet authoritative, like an invocation of holy writ or communal law, and yet this comment is something much more mundane, prosaic, and patently incomplete.” (Marino, 2020, p. 94) Executable code has an air of authority, which comments may lack“the code becomes a document of process” (Marino, 2020, p. 94)“The many voices of the commentary represent not only the multiple authorship but also the heteroglossia of the code, to use Bakhtin’s notion, the many genres and styles within even one set of comments composed by the same programmer.” (Marino, 2020, p. 95)“Such a statement sounds maudlin, but it is important to remember that this code is not merely a system of causes and effects, of calculations, but a representation of potential real-world moments with dire consequences.” (Marino, 2020, p. 98)“muted affect” (Marino, 2020, p. 99) Emotional effect of code, even when written for a life-and-death situation“it is important not to limit our readings of the code to one context and not to privilege denotations over connotations, literal references and designations over figurative ones, even though they do (and must) provide a basis for interpretation.” (Marino, 2020, p. 103)

“The discussions that followed, though driven by misreading the intent of the code, gave this code a new meaning that would shape its significance thereafter, demonstrating another way that code accrues meaning through its circulation.” (Marino, 2020, p. 112)“Jeremy Douglass has called code reading “in the wild” (2011).” (Marino, 2020, p. 115)“In performing his incredulity when reading the code, the interpreter attempts to insinuate the duplicitous intentions of the programmer in a way that engages his readers as confederates, with a bit of ire toward the scientific elite who have tried to dupe them.” (Marino, 2020, p. 120) This is one of many excellent little moments of reception analysis in this chapter. This is good stuff.“Tumblr blog PHP Manual Masterpieces.” (Marino, 2020, p. 124)“Douglas Thomas (2002) characterized in Hacker Culture” (Marino, 2020, p. 125)“it demonstrates the need for more code literacy,4” (Marino, 2020, p. 127) If code becomes part of public debate, then people need to learn how to read it.

“12. SET OPERATION 9 TO GO TO OPERATION 2 .” (Marino, 2020, p. 129) self-modifying code“However, because language, culture, and epistemologies are so closely intertwined, to choose one specific natural language for a base language has significant implications for those who will use it, particularly for those who come from different linguistic backgrounds.” (Marino, 2020, p. 131)“colonizing effects” (Marino, 2020, p. 131) This is the Abstract Wikipedia people's point...“to make a programming language similar to any one language makes it potentially more accessible to some, yet less hospitable to others” (Marino, 2020, p. 132)“Marie Hicks (2017)” (Marino, 2020, p. 132)“in many ways spreadsheets have become the most accessible of the business programming environments with their formulas, pivot tables, and built-in functions, a site of programming that often goes unnoticed in discussions of programming languages because of their ubiquity and perhaps because of their interface” (Marino, 2020, p. 133) This point is made by Christina *** in her "Exercises in Programming Style" – she has a chapter in which a Python program simulates a spreadsheet.“encoded chauvinism, the name I give denigrating expressions of superiority in matters concerning programming, which I see as a foundational element of the toxic climate in programming culture,” (Marino, 2020, p. 134)“History of Programming Languages, Richard Wexelblat (1981)” (Marino, 2020, p. 135)“The legibility of programing is subjective. Baker (2014) argues that FLOW-MATIC’s COMPARE syntax offers a more intuitive evaluation structure” (Marino, 2020, p. 141)“In so doing, FLOW-MATIC addresses the human reader as its primary audience—or, perhaps more accurately if we represent the audience as a spectrum between human and machine, FLOW-MATIC is closer to the human side, but, as this example demonstrates, it is still quite close to the specific machine on which it was implemented.” (Marino, 2020, p. 146)“Arguably, almost all English tokens in programming languages are false cognates because words in code simply do not behave the way they do in spoken or written language, except perhaps through the use of metaphor, as in the case of performative language as framed by J. L. Austin (discussed in chapter 1).” (Marino, 2020, p. 147) Really? Is it really "false" that FLOW-MATIC "reads" data from a tape? Is it "false" that it "GOES TO" instruction X?“As Dijkstra (1982) wrote, “The use of COBOL cripples the mind; its teaching should, therefore, be regarded as a criminal offense” (130). Hyperbole is a hallmark of encoded chauvinism,” (Marino, 2020, p. 148) Dikstra as proponent of "encoded chauvinism"“I offer this as merely one small example of the way natural-seeming programming languages can lull a newbie into thinking the language can understand a statement rather than process it.” (Marino, 2020, p. 150) Humanists are really keen on the idea that interfaces are illusions.“Natural Language in the Postcolonial Age” (Marino, 2020, p. 151)“As Toal (pers. comm., September 26, 2018) notes: “We are at a point in history where things took off in an English-speaking milieu. Python was designed by Guido von Rossum whose native language was Dutch. Ruby by Yukihiro Matsumoto whose native language was Japanese. Lua came from Brazil. Erlang from Sweden. José Valim from Brazil did Elixir. To make a widely used programming language right now, English is where to go. Most of the keywords and function names start looking the same.”” (Marino, 2020, p. 151)“The pervasiveness of English in programming languages demonstrates the hegemony of what has been called “global English” and “global Englishes.”” (Marino, 2020, p. 152) This argument is pat. The hegemony of English certainly has an evil cause: the British quest for world domination. Millions of people were starved or shot to make English the de facto source of vocabulary for Python. It is a pity that it didn't spread the way Sanskrit did. But is it so terrible today for there to be a lingua franca of programming, which is also the lingua franca of science? A person can learn a single language, and access nearly all the world's computer science, all the world's documentation, and a some useful mnemonics to hand for all the world's programming languages.“which compels speakers of other languages to learn English due to its “cultural capital.” 13” (Marino, 2020, p. 152)“In the ʻAnuʻu project, a Hawaiian team is working to translate the C\# programming language into ʻōlelo Hawaiʻi “as a move to initialize and support decolonial processes in the development of digital media.”14 The team includes Kari Noe, Nathan Nahina, Kauwila Mahi, Noe Arista, and Jason Edward Lewis, who met while participating in the Skins Workshops on Aboriginal Storytelling and Video Game Design codirected by Lewis and organized under the Aboriginal Territories in Cyberspace research network.15” (Marino, 2020, p. 154)“Could a programmer engage that level of logic to write code in a dominant language to express concepts or worldviews from another culture—for example, an indigenous one? Wrestling with this question, Jon M. R. Corbett, a programmer of Métis heritage, has been asking what it would mean to code from an indigenous perspective. In “Four Generations” (2015), he created a program that would produce beaded portraits in the traditional Métis manner of his grandmother, his father, himself, and his son.” (Marino, 2020, p. 155)“By reflecting on historically situated code objects, asking about not just audience and authorship but also accessibility and access, we trace the edges of more complex sociotechnological histories.” (Marino, 2020, p. 159)

“Friedrich Kittler is the media theorist known for his provocative declaration titling his essay “There Is No Software” (1992), in which he makes the argument that code is a kind of illusion, for in the end, everything done in code is reduced to electronic signals. Given that position, it might be surprising to have a chapter of this book devoted to the analysis of his computer code, of which he reportedly wrote over one hundred thousand lines (Parikka and Feigelfeld 2015).” (Marino, 2020, p. 166)“His most famous works are Discourse Networks and Gramophone, Film, Typewriter (GFT; originally published in 1986), though “There Is No Software” is often cited in scholarship about software or code.4” (Marino, 2020, p. 169)“In the article, Kittler explains how the “tower of babel” of programming languages must in the end be reduced to machine language and, in turn, electrical signals.” (Marino, 2020, p. 170) Isn't this a bit like saying that all writing can be reduced to instructions for the printer, scribe or reciter?““For Kittler, ultimately, object-orientation (a programming paradigm he abhorred) meant the necessary escalation towards our being subjects of media technologies” (Parikka and Feigelfeld 2015).” (Marino, 2020, p. 172)“On one hand, code writing offered a fulfillment of the dream of romantic poetry, a language that makes things happen.” (Marino, 2020, p. 172) Kittler seems to have had a Culler-esque theory of poetry; code is lyrical, because it apostrophises the machine – only, the machine actually responds“As he once said, “Everything beautiful can be encoded, but it doesn’t make sense ... to encode for eternity” (2007b).” (Marino, 2020, p. 188)“To write code in assembly, from this point of view, seems like a return to a communication moment practically unimaginable after our fall with Derrida, who pointed out language’s fundamental separation between the signifier and what it signifies. In assembly, language seems once again tied to a material referent, albeit arbitrarily. Could we say, to continue our divine code comedy, paradise recovered? If only you don’t have to debug it.” (Marino, 2020, p. 190)“Evan Buswell (2019) argues in his dissertation (“The Epistemology of the Credit System”) that “state” is the other key dimension to critical code studies.” (Marino, 2020, p. 191)“reading a person’s code offers a sense of the writer’s understanding of the processes they are implementing and, in the case of assembly, the machine for which it is being written” (Marino, 2020, p. 193) But, hasn't he just been arguing after Foucault that authorship is an illusion? That intention doesn't matter? That Kittler copied-and-pasted from hobbyist magazines? ... Now the code is powerful evidence of his individual knowledge. What was the point of this whole discussion?“I raise this example not to argue that Kittler is somehow wrong about the nature of code, but to argue that the linguistic or symbolic system, and hence meaning, does not disappear at the moment those symbols displayed to the programmer turn into electrical signals.” (Marino, 2020, p. 196)“Furthermore, code itself becomes a means of symbolic thinking and reflection—not merely an illustration of ideas, but an expression of them.” (Marino, 2020, p. 197)
Marino 7.pdf
“Much of the code analyzed so far in this book was not designed explicitly for wider audiences beyond its developers (and maintainers),” (Marino, 2020, p. 202) This is a good reason to study libraries – they have a wide audience, at least for their API“Angus Croll’s (2015) ingenious If Hemingway Wrote JavaScript,” (Marino, 2020, p. 202)“Zach Blas’s queer programming language Transcoder (2017),” (Marino, 2020, p. 203)“By Montfort and Stern’s reading, ELIZA’s success was not that it deceived people into thinking it was human, achieving what Noah Wardrip-Fruin (2009) would later call “the ELIZA effect.”” (Marino, 2020, p. 204)“Elegance is in the eye of the person reading or writing the code; computational devices, as far as we know, are largely indifferent to such aesthetics. Perhaps a provisional definition of elegance is concision mixed with cleverness without obfuscation.” (Marino, 2020, p. 207)“To understand how this code becomes an aesthetic object, one has to stop thinking about code as something purely functional (such as the plumbing in your house) and instead as something both functional and aesthetic” (Marino, 2020, p. 209)“As he is fond of constraints, Montfort applied some to this generator. For example, the code was not to exceed a page.” (Marino, 2020, p. 210) It wasn't much of a constraint! The code is many lines longer than it needs to be...“two versions of the same code” (Marino, 2020, p. 215) What makes these two different programs 'versions' of each other? There is an interesting contrast here with other artworks. How would it be taken if a poet wrote three texts in different languages that "make the same point" – could they be considered "versions" of the same poem? Code certainly seems to exist differently to prose or verse.

“Reading Project (Pressman, Marino, and Douglass 2015), in which two other scholars, Jessica Pressman and Jeremy Douglass, joined me for a collaborative exploration of one work of digital literature.” (Marino, 2020, p. 230) CCS + DH example“A Preliminary List of Approaches” (Marino, 2020, p. 231) Useful list of approaches, which could form the basis for little exercises in code analysis.“Reading the aesthetics of the code against the aesthetics of the software’s interface or output” (Marino, 2020, p. 232)“• Examining the rhetoric of the code • Examining the design priorities of the code • Examining models and other world representations” (Marino, 2020, p. 232)“the critic must determine the function of the code before they can begin to understand its extrafunctional significance.” (Marino, 2020, p. 233) denotation before connotation“Examining the changes to programs over time is a useful strategy for understanding the life of the code, how it made its current form known to its developers.” (Marino, 2020, p. 234)

“Unless someone wishes to embark on the task of uncritically documenting militaryindustrial-academic artifacts on behalf of those who created them to the benefit of their creators’ self-regard, I do not recommend treating this examination as an empirical activity rooted in objectivity.” (Marino, 2020, p. 1) Empiricism isn't very useful if you want to understand the extrafunctional significance of code.“Such reckless and indulgent humanism may not lead to smaller, faster, more efficient code, but it may lead to something far more valuable: understanding.” (Marino, 2020, p. 1)

	abstract = {Digital platforms have reshaped the creative industries and restructured relationships between media sectors. Creative writing and reading social media platforms like Wattpad are challenging what it means to publish fiction in the early 21st century, and digital streaming platforms like Netflix, Hulu and others have begun looking to these platforms to source creative content for adaptation. Praxis on creative writing social media platforms is shaped by a complex and ongoing interplay between the technocultural and socio-economic conditions of platforms and their users. This article argues for an integration of publishing studies and platform studies by applying a media ecology framework to map behaviour on Wattpad, one of the largest creative writing social media platforms, and the relationships it has developed with other media companies. Specifically, it draws on and extends José van Dijck’s ((2013) The Culture of Connectivity: A Critical History of Social Media. New York, NY: Oxford University Press.) microsystem/ecosystem connective media model and proposes a broader conceptualisation of the entertainment ecosystem that incorporates adaptation of content across the book publishing and entertainment media sectors. Mapping these platforms alongside legacy media and publishing companies offers a productive framework for theorising contemporary entertainment media production within the platform media landscape.},

              , Van Dijck, Poell, and De Waal offer a comprehensive analysis of a connective world where platforms have penetrated the heart of societies—disrupting markets and labor relations, transforming social and civic practices, and affecting democratic processes.
              The Platform Society
              analyzes intense struggles between competing ideological systems and contesting societal actors—market, government, and civil society—asking who is or should be responsible for anchoring public values and the common good in a platform society. Public values include, of course, privacy, accuracy, safety, and security; but they also pertain to broader societal effects, such as fairness, accessibility, democratic control, and accountability. Such values are the very stakes in the struggle over the platformization of societies around the globe.
              The Platform Society
              highlights how these struggles play out in four private and public sectors: news, urban transport, health, and education. Some of these conflicts highlight local dimensions, for instance, fights over regulation between individual platforms and city councils, while others address the geopolitical level where power clashes between global markets and (supra-)national governments take place.},

I explore this shift with a historical perspective on, what I refer to as, platformization, or the rise of the platform as the dominant infrastructural and economic model of the social web and its consequences. Platformization entails the extension of social media platforms into the rest of the web and their drive to make external web data “platform ready.” The specific technological architecture and ontological distinctiveness of platforms will be examined by taking their programmability into account. I position platformization as a form of platform critique that inquires into the dynamics of the decentralization of platform features and the recentralization of “platform ready” data as a way to examine the consequences of the programmability of social media platforms for the web.},

This concept is used to examine MySpace and Facebook at the levels of aesthetics, code, culture, and appeal to marketers. I argue that instead of creating an architecture of abstraction in which users’ affect and content were easily reduced to marketer-friendly data sets, MySpace allowed users to create a cacophony of “pimped” profiles that undermined efforts to monetize user-generated content. In contrast, Facebook has proven to be extremely efficient at reducing users to commodifiable data sets within a muted, bland interface that does not detract from marketing efforts.},

One term in particular, ‘platform’, reveals the contours of this discursive work. The term has been deployed in both their populist appeals and their marketing pitches, sometimes as technical ‘platforms’, sometimes as ‘platforms’ from which to speak, sometimes as ‘platforms’ of opportunity. Whatever tensions exist in serving all of these constituencies are carefully elided. The term also fits their efforts to shape information policy, where they seek protection for facilitating user expression, yet also seek limited liability for what those users say. As these providers become the curators of public discourse, we must examine the roles they aim to play, and the terms by which they hope to be judged.},

78 – Brand’s vision for the Whole Earth Catalog (quote): “the problem was How to Generate a Low-Maintenance High-Yield Self-Sustaining Critical Information Service”
219 – Hacking as a social vision in Wired: “The urge to ‘hack’ politics by bringing governance down to a manageably local level and by basing social integration on technologically facilitated forms of consciousness was one of the driving impulses behind the New Communalist movement. Now, however, the old hammer-and-saw-wielding, do-it-yourself ethos of the back-to-the-landers has been fused to the craft ethic of computer programmers.”
261 – The key flaw of the cyberlibertarian utopia, disembodiment: “Even as they conjured up visions of a disembodied, peer-to-peer utopia, and even as they suggested that such a world would in fact represent a return to a more natural, more intimate state of being, writers such as Kevin Kelly, Esther Dyson and John Perry Barlow deprived their many readers of a language with which to think about the complex ways in which embodiment shapes all of human life, about the natural and social infrastructures on which that life depends, and about the effects that digital technologies and the network mode of production might have on life and its essential infrastructures.”
This story is so familiar to the Romanticist. First they try to create communes, then they decide to renovate consciousness instead of their materials lives… Perhaps this provides a useful context for the aestheticisation of source code in hacker culture.

In particular, it addresses language imbalances on Wikipedia with regard to geographical information and uneven spatial patterns of territory coverage on the different language versions in an attempt to verify expectations about the cultural factors that influence these imbalances and uneven spatial patterns. Ukraine is a promising case for testing the formulated expectations, as it has a large number of neighbouring countries, and most of them had political and cultural influence on its territory in the past. The volumes (word counts) of articles about the Ukrainian cities were analysed for seven language versions of Wikipedia, including the Ukrainian version and the versions of all bordering countries. The results show that historical geography is the strongest and central factor, and most of the key relic borders (former boundaries) can be traced. Ethnic composition appears to be another important factor, although weaker than the previous one. The role of the border factor is often unclear, but in some cases it definitely makes an impact and therefore cannot be completely ignored. Thus, the geographies of Wikipedia are not indifferent to the issues of ethnicity and geopolitics. The research calls into question the ability of modern Wikipedia to be a reliable and balanced source of geographical knowledge, as the described imbalances may create lopsided and biased geographical representations in people from different countries and nations.},

However, the decision-making processes that are made available to stakeholders are at times incomplete and may remain buried and hidden in large amounts of software repository data. This work bridges this gap by unearthing enacted decision-making processes available for Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) from 1.54 million email messages that embody decisions made during the evolution of the Python language. This work employs a design science approach in operationalizing a framework called DeMaP miner that is used to discover hidden processes using information retrieval and information extraction techniques. It also uses process mining techniques to visualize the processes, and comparative structural analysis techniques to compare different decision processes. The work identifies a richer set of decision-making activities than those reported on the Python website and in prior research work (48 new decision activities, 199 new pathways and 6 new stages). The extracted decision process has been positively evaluated by a prominent member of the Python steering council. The extracted process can be used for process compliance checking and process improvement in OSS communities. Additionally, the DeMaP Miner framework can be extended and customized to suit other OSS projects, such as the OpenJDK project.},

It serves both as a solution to the problem of curating massive collections of user-generated content and as a rhetorical justification for platform owners when they decide to remove content. Flags are becoming a ubiquitous mechanism of governance—yet their meaning is anything but straightforward. In practice, the interactions between users, flags, algorithms, content moderators, and platforms are complex and highly strategic. Significantly, flags are asked to bear a great deal of weight, arbitrating both the relationship between users and platforms, and the negotiation around contentious public issues. In this essay, we unpack the working of the flag, consider alternatives that give greater emphasis to public deliberation, and consider the implications for online public discourse of this now commonplace yet rarely studied sociotechnical mechanism.},

‘A typical perspective on code would be that clarity and elegance are the only possible values that programmers can have when writing it, although they may succeed to a greater or lesser extent at writing clear and elegant code. But if this were the case, how is it possible to explain the way that people sometimes intentionally obfuscate their code, making its functioning more or less impenetrable, even when there is no commercial or practical reason to do so? The existence of obfuscated programming as a software development practice, and as an aesthetic practice, throws a wrench into the simplified theory of coding that would claim that coders must always strive for clarity’ (p. 1)
‘By showing how much room there is to program in perplexing ways—and yet accomplishing astounding results at the same time—obfuscated programs demonstrate that C is powerful, and also that clarity in C code is achieved only with effort’ (p. 4)
‘Their play with Perl and C is not pure pillory. In addition to making fun of some 'misfeatures' or abusable features of the languages, obfuscated code shows how powerful, flexible programming languages allow for creative coding, not only in terms of the output but in terms of the legibility and appearance of the source code’ (p. 4).
‘Obfuscation and weird languages invite us to join programming contexts to the literary contexts that must obviously be considered when evaluating literary code. They also suggest that coding can resist clarity and elegance to strive instead for complexity, can make the familiar unfamiliar, and can wrestle with the language in which it is written, just as much contemporary literature does‘ (p. 10)

It also raises questions about the class of automata that can serve as a basis for understanding the mind. I develop an account of implementation, linked to an appropriate class of automata, such that the requirement that a system implement a given automaton places a very strong constraint on the system.

	abstract = {Clojure was designed to be a general-purpose, practical functional language, suitable for use by professionals wherever its host language, e.g., Java, would be. Initially designed in 2005 and released in 2007, Clojure is a dialect of Lisp, but is not a direct descendant of any prior Lisp. It complements programming with pure functions of immutable data with concurrency-safe state management constructs that support writing correct multithreaded programs without the complexity of mutex locks.
            Clojure is intentionally hosted, in that it compiles to and runs on the runtime of another language, such as the JVM. This is more than an implementation strategy; numerous features ensure that programs written in Clojure can leverage and interoperate with the libraries of the host language directly and efficiently.
            In spite of combining two (at the time) rather unpopular ideas, functional programming and Lisp, Clojure has since seen adoption in industries as diverse as finance, climate science, retail, databases, analytics, publishing, healthcare, advertising and genomics, and by consultancies and startups worldwide, much to the career-altering surprise of its author.
            Most of the ideas in Clojure were not novel, but their combination puts Clojure in a unique spot in language design (functional, hosted, Lisp). This paper recounts the motivation behind the initial development of Clojure and the rationale for various design decisions and language constructs. It then covers its evolution subsequent to release and adoption.},

“The slogan of thehacker class is not the workers of the world united, but theworkings of the world untied.” (Wark, 2004, p. 16)“Debord: “The world already possesses thedream of a time whose consciousness it must now possessin order to actually live it.”*” (Wark, 2004, p. 17)“Unlike farmers and workers, hackers have not—yet—beendispossessed of their property rights entirely, but still mustsell their capacity for abstraction to a class that owns themeans of production, the vectoralist class—the emergentruling class of our time.” (Wark, 2004, p. 20)“The vectoralist class wages an intensive struggle to dispos-sess hackers of their intellectual property. Patents and copy-rights all end up in the hands, not of their creators, but of avectoralist class that owns the means of realizing the valueof these abstractions” (Wark, 2004, p. 20)“Information, like land or capital, becomes a form of prop-erty monopolized by a class, a class of vectoralists, sonamed because they control the vectors along which infor-mation is abstracted, just as capitalists control the materialmeans with which goods are produced, and pastoralists theland with which food is produced” (Wark, 2004, p. 24)“Education is not knowledge. Nor is it the necessary meansto acquire knowledge. Knowledge may arise just as readilyfrom everyday life. Education is the organization of knowl-edge within the constraints of scarcity, under the sign ofproperty.” (Wark, 2004, p. 37)“Hackerknowledge is knowledge that expresses the virtuality of na-ture, by transforming it, fully aware of the bounty anddanger” (Wark, 2004, p. 42)“ducers. This may sound like utopia, but the accounts ofactually existing temporary zones of hacker liberty arelegion. Stallman: “It was a bit like the garden of Eden. Ithadn’t occurred to us not to cooperate.”*” (Wark, 2004, p. 42)“The virtual is the true domain of the hacker. It is from thevirtual that the hacker produces ever-new expressions of theactual. To the hacker, what is represented as being real is al-ways partial, limited, perhaps even false. To the hacker thereis always a surplus of possibility expressed in what is actual,the surplus of the virtual. This is the inexhaustible domainof what is real but not actual, what is not but which maybecome. The domain where, as Massumi says, “what can-not be experienced cannot but be felt.”* To hack is to releasethe virtual into the actual, to express the difference of thereal” (Wark, 2004, p. 45)“The interest of thehacker class lies first and foremost in a free circulation of in-formation, this being the necessary condition for the re-newed expression of the hack. But the hacker class as classalso has a tactical interest in the representation of the hackas property, as something from which a source of incomemay be derived that gives the hacker some independencefrom the ruling classes. The hacker class opens the virtualinto the historical when it hacks a way to make the latter de-sire a mere particular of the former.” (Wark, 2004, p. 48)“For everyone to become free to join in the virtuality ofknowledge, information and the capacity to grasp it must befree also, so that all classes may have the potential to hackfor themselves and their kind a new way of life” (Wark, 2004, p. 71) *the wikifunctions ideal“Free information must be free in all its aspects—as a stock,as a flow, and as a vector” (Wark, 2004, p. 71) Is this equivalent to “free as in freedom, not free as in beer”?“The sign of a free world isthe liberty for the collective transformation of the worldthrough abstractions freely chosen and freely actualized.” (Wark, 2004, p. 72)“The hack expresses the nature of nature as its differencefrom itself—or at least its difference from its representation.The hack expresses the virtuality of nature and nature as thevirtuality of expression.” (Wark, 2004, p. 74)“Nature knows no objects, no subjects, and no representa-tion. Its appearance in representation as object or subject isa false appearance. Yet it is only in its falsity that it can be ap-prehended in class society, which produces the relation be-tween nature and second nature as an objectified relation” (Wark, 2004, p. 77) Schopenhauer via Marx“Thisis the endless anxiety of the vectoral class: that the very vir-tuality they depend on, that uncanny capacity of the hackerclass to mint new properties for commodification, threatensto hack into existence new forms of production beyondcommodification, beyond class rule.” (Wark, 2004, p. 84)“The vectoralistclass knows this, and does its best to reduce productivity toproperty, information to communication, expression to rep-resentation, nature to necessity.” (Wark, 2004, p. 89)“Under the influence ofcapital, the state sanctions nascent forms of intellectualproperty, such as patents and copyrights, that secure an inde-pendent existence for hackers as a class, and a flow of inno-vations in culture and science from which history issues” (Wark, 2004, p. 95) “History” is something metaphysical in Wark’s writing“If what defines the activity ofhacking is that it is a free productivity, an expression of thevirtuality of nature, then its subjection to private propertyand the commodity form is a fetter upon it. “When themeaning of a string of characters can be bought and lockedinto place this is the thermodynamics of language reducedto a single cryogenic chamber.”*” (Wark, 2004, p. 98) *“Where the farmer suffered the enclosure of the pastoralcommons, the hacker must resist the enclosure of the infor-mation commons” (Wark, 2004, p. 98)“The politics of information, the history of knowledge, ad-vance not through a critical negation of false representa-tions but a positive hacking of the virtuality of expression.Representation always mimics but is less than what it repre-sents; expression always differs from but exceeds the rawmaterial of its production.” (Wark, 2004, p. 104) Representation vs expression“All representation is false. A likeness differs of necessityfrom what it represents. If it did not, it would be what it rep-resents, and thus not a representation. The only truly falserepresentation is the belief in the possibility of true repre-sentation” (Wark, 2004, p. 104) What is the difference between representation and abstraction? Surely abstraction must be “false” in just this way?“The critique of the politics of representation is at the sametime the critique of representation as politics. No one is au-thorized to speak on behalf of constituencies as propertiesor on the properties of constituencies. Even this manifesto,which invokes a collective name, does so without claimingor seeking authorization, and offers for agreement only thegift of its own possibility.” (Wark, 2004, p. 106)“To hack is to trouble the object orthe subject, by transforming in some way the very processof production by which objects and subjects come into be-ing and recognize each other by their representations. Thehack touches the unrepresentable, the real.” (Wark, 2004, p. 109)“Where once, as Marx wrote,“religion is the opium of the people,” now Opium™ is the religion of the people.*” (Wark, 2004, p. 134)“There are hackers of subjective desire just as there arehackers of the objectified world, and just as the latter hacktoward the free expressivity of nature from which all objec-tifications arise, so too do the former hack beyond the con-straints of the subject limited to its apprehension of itselfand the existing order” (Wark, 2004, p. 138)“nformation wants to be free, that its scarcity is maintained only by the artificial means of the commodification of the vector and the policing of representation by the state” (Wark, 2004, p. 146)“All are forms of telesthesia, or perception at a distance.” (Wark, 2004, p. 148)“Extracting a surplus frominformation requires technologies capable of transportinginformation through space, but also through time. The stor-age of information may be as valuable as its transmission,and the archive is a vector through time just as telesthesia isa vector through space. The whole potential of space andtime becomes the object of the vectoral class.” (Wark, 2004, p. 150)“Avector is the means of achieving either the temporal distri-bution of a stock, or the spatial distribution of a flow of in-formation” (Wark, 2004, p. 151)“Nothing in the nature of the vectordetermines that it must be deployed here rather than there,between these persons rather than those, between these cit-ies rather than these hinterlands, these empires rather thanthese peripheries. Nothing about the vector in the abstractsays what flows along it must only flow one way, from bossto hand, from metropolis to province, from empire to col-ony, from the overdeveloped to the underdeveloped world.And yet this is the vectoral as we find it” (Wark, 2004, p. 156) Is the vector nevertheless a useful concept? If an undersea cable does not have the vector-nature, then what exactly is the point of all this talk about vectors?“A vectoral subjectivity arises which isnot the universal enlightened subject long dreamt of in theoverdeveloped world. Vectoral subjectivity is abstract, butnot universal. It acquires its specificity as the internalizingof the differentiation of values that appear on the abstractplane of the vector” (Wark, 2004, p. 159)“The hacker class virtualizes, the producingclasses actualize.” (Wark, 2004, p. 160)“The vectoral class detaches powerfrom its spatial fixity. It dreams of a world in which place gives way to space,” (Wark, 2004, p. 166)“The choices facing the productive classes of the underde-veloped world are even starker. When their states lose theirsovereignty, they become a resource for the global produc-tion of food and goods, which everywhere seeks to extractthe maximum surplus. The state loses its ability to socialize part of that surplus as a condition of access to capital andentry to the emerging global order.” (Wark, 2004, p. 168) *Here Wark’a argument intersects with Indigenous Data Sovereignty“The challenge for the producing classes is not merely to re-act to the vector, or use it reactively, but to see beyond its ac-tual form to its virtual form.” (Wark, 2004, p. 170) Has she distinguished actual from virtual vectors before? Is this how she makes the concept useful, despite the earlier problems?“The interestof the hacker class lies first and foremost in the free expan-sion of the vectors of communication, culture and knowl-edge around the globe. Only through the free abstraction ofthe flow of information from local prejudice and contingentinterests can its virtuality be fully realized” (Wark, 2004, p. 174)“In this tiresome age, when even the air melts into airwaves, where all that is profane is packaged as if it were profundity,the possibility yet emerges to hack into mere appearancesand make off with them. There are other worlds and theyare this one.” (Wark, 2004, p. 178)“Throughout A Hacker Manifesto, certain pro-tocols of reading are applied to the various textual archives on which it draws, and which call for some explanation. It is not so much a “symptomatic” reading as a homeopathic one, turning texts against their own limitations, imposed on them by their conditions of production. F” (Wark, 2004, p. 180) Hacker reading“From Marx one might take the attempt to dis-cover abstraction at work in the world, as an historical process,rather than as merely a convenient category in thought withwhich to create a new intellectual product.” (Wark, 2004, p. 181)“Having lost the right to plagiarize and co-opt and modify works as they please, readers find their only right is to purchase works frompublishers. Publishers then claim that anything that takes awaytheir sales is “piracy.” Au” (Wark, 2004, p. 188) Is this a difference between publishers and platforms? Publishers not only take responsibility for what they publish, but also claim ownership.“Pekka Himanen, The Hacker Ethic and the Spirit of the Information Age (New York: Random House, 2001), pp. 7, 18, 13. If A Hacker Ethic seeks to resurrect the spirit of Max Weber, then A Hacker Manifesto offers a crypto-Marxist response. Himanen’s excellent work has much to say on hacker time and its antithesis to commodified time, and yet Himanen still seeks to reconcile the hacker with the vectoral class. He wilfully confuses the hacker with the “entrepreneur.” The hacker produces the new; the entrepreneur merely discovers its price. In the vectoral economy, where much of what is on offer has no use value whatsoever, and exchange value is a mere speculative possibility, the entrepreneur is a heroic figure when and if he or she can invent new necessities ex nihil. Here the “invisible hand” is a poker player’s bluff. The entrepreneur merely reiterates unnecessary necessity; the hacker expresses the virtual. The confusion of one with the other is an ideological sleight of hand meant to lend some glamor to the dismal necromancy of vectoral power.” (Wark, 2004, p. 189) hacker ≠ entrepreneur“homeopathic practice of reading, which completesthe critique begun in the text of the world by turning theworld, in turn, against the text. This is a reading which appro-priates what is useful from heterogeneous discourses and syn-thesizes them in a writing that addresses the hacker class within the temporality of everyday life, rather than addressing thereified time and space of education.” (Wark, 2004, p. 192) Another comment on the nature of homeopathic reading. I’m still not quite sure what she means!“But time is multiple, heterogeneous. Thereis no reason not to experiment with public networks, data re-gifting, temporary autonomous zones, strategies for tactical media—right now. Nor is there any reason to think that theleading innovations in freeing the vector from the vectoral class might not come from the underdeveloped world.” (Wark, 2004, p. 195)

Platform companies, such as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft use Wikidata to retrieve and transmit facts across the internet, while researchers rely on Wikidata as a data source for facts. Various Wikipedia researchers have commended Wikidata for its collaborative nature and liberatory potential, yet less attention has been paid to the social and political implications of Wikidata. This article aims to advance work in this context by introducing the concept of semantic infrastructure and outlining how Wikidata’s role as semantic infrastructure is the primary vehicle by which Wikipedia has become infrastructural for digital platforms. We develop two key themes that build on questions of power that arise in infrastructure studies and apply to Wikidata: knowledge representation and data labor. We argue that considering these issues about Wikidata helps contextualize such infrastructural technologies within existing media and communication studies debates and highlights the contingencies upon which their outcomes depend.},

Chapter 1 and Bibliography
“There are two ways to win the Turing Test. The hard way is to build computers that are more and more intelligent, until we can’t tell them apart from humans. The easy way is to make humans more and more stupid, until we can’t tell them apart from computers. The purpose of this book is to help us avoid that second path.” (Blackwell, 2024, p. 1)
“Turing’s paper is a remarkable piece of work, and it is still an excellent introduction to many central questions in AI, including some that I will return to in this book. But it is also a work of imagination, in a very long tradition of stories that raise intriguing questions about what it means to be human.” (Blackwell, 2024, p. 4) Turing's machine thinking paper as 'work of imagination'
“A good definition of AI is the branch of computer science dedicated to making computers work the way they do in the movies.” (Blackwell, 2024, p. 4)
“The Two Kinds of AI” (Blackwell, 2024, p. 5) Blackwell offers a different bifurcation. He does not distinguish symbolic from subsymbolic. He distinguishes "cybernetic AI", which is concerned with systems that respond intelligently to their environment, and "philosophical" AI, which "explore[s] the subjective nature of human experience"
“inspired by so many literary fantasies” (Blackwell, 2024, p. 6) Turing was inspired by literary fantasies.
“The claims that increasing computer power will eventually result in fundamental change are hard to justify on technical grounds; some say this is like arguing that if we make airplanes fly fast enough, eventually one will lay an egg.” (Blackwell, 2024, p. 7)
“Computer programs are no more or less than a system of rules about how to behave, and any questions about the moral basis of what a program does must look first at those rules.” (Blackwell, 2024, p. 8) Useful ambiguity here: Blackwell deliberately doesn't specify whether it's human or computer behaviour that is governed by code.
“The fictional problem of distant-future robot “alignment,” as an alternative to today’s pressing but technically mundane problems of business ethics and government regulation, might just be a distraction, and one that is convenient for the large companies that are building and investing in AI.” (Blackwell, 2024, p. 9)
“But we also need to understand why and how being programmed is the opposite of moral agency.” (Blackwell, 2024, p. 10)
“As Nobel Prize–winning economist Herbert Simon famously wrote: “In an information-rich world, the wealth of information means a dearth of something else: a scarcity of whatever it is that information consumes. What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention.”21” (Blackwell, 2024, p. 11)
“Whenever a person is made into a conscious component of a machine, their capacity for meaningful attention gets reduced to the mechanical role they play, whether a call-center worker, delivery driver, shipment packer, or an online ghost worker checking social media posts for offensive content.” (Blackwell, 2024, p. 11)
“a steady tide of mechanized trivialization.” (Blackwell, 2024, p. 12)
“I’ve already observed that one of the worst distractions we experience is the temptation to avoid the urgent problems of today by instead debating the theoretical problems of the far future.” (Blackwell, 2024, p. 12)
“The problem with this supposed existential risk is that it comes from a fictional premise. If I imagine a super-AI that, like Superman, can do anything at all, then of course my imaginary software can use its superpowers to do anything in my imaginary world, including writing the code to create itself. Like a fairy story character whose final wish to the genie is for another three wishes, the logic is appealing in stories, but impossible in real life. The circular argument of superintelligence creating itself is only possible by avoiding a clear definition of what intelligence is, and also avoiding the question of what kind of code might be needed to write down that definition. It’s reminiscent of St. Anselm’s proof of the existence of God, which proceeds from the premise that God can’t be defined because He is greater than anything we know.” (Blackwell, 2024, p. 13) Kaboom!
“AI companies like to sponsor academic debates into magical technologies that might exist in the distant future, addressing ethical problems that would only become relevant a century or two after the sponsors have enjoyed a luxurious and untroubled old age.” (Blackwell, 2024, p. 14)
“As I discuss in more detail in chapter 13, philosopher Stephen Cave explains how the scientific history of “intelligence” itself was invented alongside other principles of measuring and comparing human bodies, driven by the need for evidence that could justify a scientific theory of race as a basis for eugenics, genocide, and slavery.27” (Blackwell, 2024, p. 15)
“The real priority for future computers should not be what we want when we’re not saying anything, but rather what language we should speak if we are going to be able to tell them what to do. By describing these languages as moral codes, I want to draw attention to the importance of programming languages, but also to how the power of programming languages could become more widely available, and how more kinds of interaction with computers could gain the power and control available through programming.” (Blackwell, 2024, p. 16) *Central thesis of the book.
“Agre’s classic essay, “Toward a Critical Technical Practice: Lessons Learned in Trying to Reform AI,” explains the urgent need for researchers who are able both to build sophisticated software, and also to understand sophisticated arguments.31” (Blackwell, 2024, p. 17)
“Agre argued that where AI researchers had been doing covert philosophy, it needed to be made overt—code must be open and theory must be coded, not with layers of wishful thinking, magical fantasy, or speculation about dystopian futures, but with open and accessible software representations.” (Blackwell, 2024, p. 29)
Chapter 2
“Like many people who work at the intersection of AI and user experience, Allen Cypher is a mathematician who is really interested in people. After finishing a PhD in theoretical computer science, he used programming skills—a rare qualification in the 1970s—from his teenage years to teach a class at Yale in “computer programming for poets,” in order to hang out with the researchers working on natural language understanding in AI pioneer Roger Schank’s group. 1980s AI involved writing out knowledge as rules; machine learning methods were still in their infancy, associated with “connectionist” neural networks and brain science.” (Blackwell, 2024, p. 3)
“the fundamental problem of machine learning ever since: how can a system learn to generalize from a set of examples, creating an abstract representation that defines the range of likely future variations?” (Blackwell, 2024, p. 4)
“AI programming systems were too unusable for the experts to get their knowledge encoded.” (Blackwell, 2024, p. 5) An interesting take: the rain that expert systems failed was that the experts couldn’t program them themselves.
“Those exclusions are a lot more consequential than determining whether you are able to save yourself a few hours by writing a macro in Microsoft Word. This is about getting computers to do what you want. In a society where many basic human rights, including the right to even be a citizen, is delivered via computer, then self-efficacy in getting computers to do what you want is fundamental. Coding—the ability to express your own wishes to a computer—has become a resource for moral agency.” (Blackwell, 2024, p. 14)
“That basic principle of attention investment—devote a bit of effort to thinking about something in advance in order to avoid mundane repetition in the future—also utilizes the basic power of abstraction.23 Each repetition is an individual concrete case that, without abstraction, must be handled individually. A program that describes how all cases should be handled is necessarily an abstraction—describing abstractly what must be done, describing abstractly how the actions might need to vary slightly in different circumstances, and defining abstractly what those circumstances are.” (Blackwell, 2024, p. 14)
“We need notation (or a recorded language of some kind) in order to use abstraction.24” (Blackwell, 2024, p. 14)
Chapter 3
“the global “AI” business of machine learning—currently focused on extracting as much data from users as possible for the minimum cost, while also consuming their attention—is a tragically ineffective way of contributing to human life and welfare. Instead, we need a moral alternative, in which the ability to instruct and configure computers is extended to a far wider range of people, delivering the capabilities of programming through moral codes.” (Blackwell, 2024, p. 1)
“The recent habit of describing statistical “learning” as “AI” has really only emerged when the amount of data became so large that it’s hard to relate it intuitively to those high school concepts.2” (Blackwell, 2024, p. 3)
“If we use such words carelessly, they become a conceptual “suitcase,” bringing with them a lot of baggage of our associations with those words as used in an everyday conversation about humans.” (Blackwell, 2024, p. 4)
“Expert systems often failed in brittle ways through lack of common sense. For example, such a system might prescribe medicine for a patient who was dead, because although the programmers had coded thousands of facts about medicine, they could easily forget to code things that were, to a human, common sense—such as that the dead won’t benefit from medicine.” (Blackwell, 2024, p. 7)
“The technical advances that actually allow us to instruct com-puters for practical purposes might have seemed like AI once, but now they are just coding.” (Blackwell, 2024, p. 9) Example of seomthing no longer being
Chapter 4
“Stochastic Parrots 🦜” (Blackwell, 2024, p. 1) What LLMs are
“Typical computers in 2021 had become about a million times more powerful than typical computers were in 1981, so you might say the intellectual advances of AI in these 40 years are disappointing given the huge scale of physical infrastructure and investment they have required.” (Blackwell, 2024, p. 3)
“In a classic publication that first alerted many readers to the now-familiar problems of large language models, Emily Bender, Timnit Gebru, and colleagues described these systems as “stochastic parrots.”10” (Blackwell, 2024, p. 5)
“As I discuss in more detail in chapter 12, what we call “creativity,” when done by a machine, is more precisely a measure of how much we are sur-prised by what the machine does. So information theory can be used in some way as a measure of creativity” (Blackwell, 2024, p. 7)
“These familiar traditional practices can be compared to the apparently supernatural or magical powers of the latest LLMs. The “stochastic” part of the stochastic parrot output is noise, not signal. It does not carry a mes-sage from anywhere, because it is not a message. But because the symbolic ingredients of the model (nearly the whole of human language) are so rich, the combination of these symbols might be interpreted as if the random noise were a message from somewhere mysterious.” (Blackwell, 2024, p. 11)
“We have centuries of history in which the performances of machine intelligence are most impressive for the variety and sophistication of ways in which the real human intelligence has been stored and hidden from the audience.” (Blackwell, 2024, p. 13)
“When AI researchers build supervised machine learning systems, then claim that the system itself is the author rather than the AMT workers who provided the training labels, this would also seem a fairly clear case of plagiarism if the labeling process required any kind of original judgement. AI researchers do not very much like to talk to the general public about the training datasets that they use, and certainly don’t like to talk about the real humans who created that data.20 In fact, the whole point of AMT is to make the Turkers anonymous—it is against the AMT rules to ask any question that might reveal the Turker’s identity.” (Blackwell, 2024, p. 13)
“Now that LLMs have shown that generating grammatical text can be a (somewhat) mechanical task, what consequences will there be for the professions dedicated to the mechanical generation of text? Will they go the way of the scribe and the clerk, at least for situations in which the text is generated as a routine necessity rather than for meaningful com-munication?” (Blackwell, 2024, p. 15)
Chapter 5
“The first is presentation of this internet model as a chatbot, by prompting it to predict the kind of text that will keep a dialogue going.” (Blackwell, 2024, p. 1)
“The second is the rapid evolution of commercial guardrails to avoid some ways of speaking on the internet and emphasize others.” (Blackwell, 2024, p. 1)
“Although the conversational style of an LLM presents its output in the first person as if it were an independent agent, like an AI character in a science fiction novel or a TV show, there is no point in asking this fictional character about its ethical stance. Do you want to know if the fictional AI character is biased? It’s better to ask: Is the internet biased? Is the AI char-acter racist and sexist? Better to ask: is the internet racist and sexist? Will the AI character look for opportunities to profit rather than share resources equitably? Obviously, the answer to all these questions is, in some parts of the internet, yes.” (Blackwell, 2024, p. 3)
“AI researchers and company presidents are desperately lobbying govern-ments all over the world for “regulation” of AI—in other words, asking for changes to the law. In their ideal world, companies want the law changed so that they can take the money while government takes away the risk.” (Blackwell, 2024, p. 4)
“Fighting stereotypical goal assumptions is one of the core opportunities of moral codes.” (Blackwell, 2024, p. 9)
“The term gamification describes a user interface design strategy where we try to make real life easier to deal with—for both humans and machine learning algorithms—by making it more like a game. Gamification might also be considered an effective example of my easy way to win the Turing Test, by making humans more stupid in comparison to computers, and life less meaningful as a result. Sadly, this strategy is often profitable.” (Blackwell, 2024, p. 10)
“The breakthrough in LLMs was the point at which they were packaged into chatbots, because the primary goal of a chatbot is to keep chatting.” (Blackwell, 2024, p. 12)

p. 2 -- "Literature is an inseparable part of culture and it cannot be understood outside the total context of the entire culture of a given epoch. It must not be severed from the rest of culture, nor, as is frequently done, can it be correlated with socioeconomic factors, as it were, behind culture's back. These factors affect culture as a whole, and only through it and in conjunction with it do they affect literature."
p. 4 -- "Great literary works are prepared for by centuries, and in the epoch of their creation it is merely a matter of picking the fruit that is ripe after a lengthy and complex process of maturation. Trying to understand and explain a work solely in terms of the conditions of its epoch alone, solely in terms of the conditions of the most immediate time, will never enable us to penetrate into its semantic depths."
p. 5 -- "Genres are of special significance. Genres (of literature and speech) throughout the centuries of their life accumulate forms of seeing and interpreting particular aspects of the world."
p. 6 -- "There exists a very strong, but one-sided and thus untrustworthy, idea that in order better to understand a foreign culture, one must enter into it, forgetting one's own, and view the world through the eyes of this foreign culture. This idea, as I said, is one-sided. Of course, a certain entry as a living being into a foreign culture, the possibility of seeing the world through its eyes, is a necessary part of the process of understanding it; but if this were the only aspect of this understanding, it would merely be duplication and would not entail anything new or enriching. Creative understanding does not renounce itself, its own place in time, its own culture; and it forgets nothing. In order to understand, it is immensely important for the person who understands to be located outside the object of his or her creative understanding-in time, in space, in culture."

p. 10 -- "Since all elements are mutually determined, the principle for formulating the hero figure is related to the particular type of plot, to the particular conception of the world, and to a particular composition of a given novel."
Novel of Ordeal
p. 14 -- "The baroque novel of ordeal had two branches of development in subsequent centuries: (1) the adventure-heroic novel (Lewis, Radcliffe, Walpole, and others); (2) the pathos-filled psychological, sentimental novel (Richardson, Rousseau). The features of the novel of ordeal change significantly in these subcategories, especially where one finds a unique heroization of the weak, the heroization of the 'little man'."
pp. 15-16 -- In the novel of ordeal: "There is no real interaction between the hero and the world: the world is not capable of changing the hero, it only tests him; and the hero does not affect the world, he does not change its appearance; while undergoing tests and vanquishing his enemies, the hero leaves everything in the world in its place." -- [in the novel of ordeal, the hero and world do not change one another]
Biographical novel
p. 17 -- Biographical novel: "The essential feature of the biographical novel is the appearance of biographical time. As distinct from adventure and fairy-tale time, biographical time is quite realistic. All of its moments are included in the total life process, and they describe this process as limited, unrepeatable, and irreversible. Each event is localized in the whole of this life process and therefore it ceases to be adventure."
p. 18 -- "Secondary characters, countries, cities, things, and so on enter into the biographical novel in significant ways and acquire a significant relationship to the whole life of the main hero. This makes it possible, in depicting the world, to surmount both the naturalistic fragmentation of the travel novel and the exoticism and abstract idealization of the novel of ordeal." -- [Hence the involuted character networks of Edgeworth, Austen, Goethe]
Novel of education
pp. 19-20 -- "There exists a special subcategory of the novel called the "novel of education" (Erziehungsroman or Bildungsroman). Usually included (in chronological order) are the following major examples of this generic subcategory: Xenophon's Cyropaedia (classical), Wolfram von Eschenbach's Parzival (Middle Ages), Rabelais' Gargantua and Pantagruel, Grimmelshausen's Simplicissimus (the Renaissance), Fenelon's Telemaque (neoclassicism), Rousseau's Emile (since there is a considerable novelistic element in this pedagogical treatise), Wieland's Agathon, Wetzel's Tobias Knout, Hippel's Lebenslaufenachaufsteigender Linie, Goethe's Wilhelm Meister (both novels), Jean Paul's Titan (and several of his other novels), Dickens' David Copperfield, Raabe's Der Hungerpastor, Gottfried Keller's Der grime Heinrich, Pontoppidan's Lucky Peter, Tolstoy's Childhood, Adolescence, and Youth, Goncharov's An Ordinary Story and Oblomov Romain Rolland's Jean-Christophe, Thomas Mann's Buddenbrooks and Magic Mountain, and others."
The Bildungsroman
p. 21 -- Key issue of historical time: "A human being can, however, emerge in quite diverse ways. Everything depends upon the degree of assimilation of real historical time."
p. 23 -- The classical Bildungsroman: "The fifth and last type of novel of emergence is the most significant one. In it man's individual emergence is inseparably linked to historical emergence. Man's emergence is accomplished in real historical time, with all of its necessity, its fullness, its future, and its profoundly chronotopic nature. In the four preceding types, man's emergence proceeded against the immobile background of the world, ready-made and basically quite stable."
p. 23 -- Historical emergence in the BR: "In such novels as Gargantua and Pantagruel, Simpluissimus, and Wilhelm Meister, however, human emergence is of a different nature. It is no longer man's own private affair. He emerges along with the world and he reflects the historical emergence of the world itself. He is no longer within an epoch, but on the border between two epochs, at the transition point from one to the other."
p. 26 -- "The contradictions of contemporary life, having lost their absolute, God-given, eternal nature, reveal a historical multitemporality--remnants of the past, and rudiments and tendencies of the future. Simultaneously the theme of the ages of man, evolving into the theme of generations, begins to lose its cyclical nature and begins to prepare for the phenomenon of historical perspectives. And this process of preparing for the disclosure of historical time took place more rapidly, completely, and profoundly in literary creativity than in the abstract philosophical and strictly historical, ideological views of Enlightenment thinkers." -- [Linked to the artificiality of convention, as observed by critics in Belinda and The Absentee?]
Goethe's view of historical time
p. 33 -- Italienische Reise: "The importance lies elsewhere. First, this is a manifestation of Goethe's characteristic dislike for the estranged past, for the past in and of itself, that past of which the romantics were so fond. He wanted to see necessary connections between this past and the living present, to understand the necessary place of this past in the unbroken line of historical development. And the isolated, estranged chunk of the past was for him a 'ghost', profoundly loathsome and even frightening."
p. 34 -- "Second-and this is a very important feature of the Goethean vision of historical time-the past itself must be creative. It must have its effect in the present (even if this effect is negative or one Goethe considers undesirable)."
p. 35 -- "When separated from man, from his needs and activities, a locality lost all apparent sense or significance for Goethe, because all criteria for evaluation, all measures, and the entire living human scale of the locality can be understood only from the standpoint of man the builder, from the standpoint of its transformation into a small part of historical life."
The world started to become historical in the Renaissance
pp. 43-4 -- "During the Renaissance the 'entire world' began to condense into a real and compact whole. The earth became firmly rounded out, and it occupied a particular position in the real space of the universe. And the earth itself began to acquire a geographical definition (still far from complete) and a historical interpretation (even less complete). In Rabelais and Cervantes we see a fundamental condensation of reality that is no longer bled by otherworldly rounding out; but this reality rises up against the still very unstable and nebulous background of the entire world and human history.The process by which the real world was rounded out, filled in, and integrated first reached its culmination in the eighteenth century, precisely by Goethe's time."
p. 44 -- "The earth's position in the solar system and its relation to other worlds of this system were determined; it became subject to interpretation and, in a real-life sense, historical. It is not just a matter of the quantity of great discoveries, new journeys, and acquired knowledge, but rather of that new quality in the comprehension of the real world that resulted from all this: from being a fact of abstract consciousness, theoretical constructs, and rare books, the new, real unity and integrity of the world became a fact of concrete (ordinary) consciousness and practical orientation, a fact of ordinary hooks and everyday thoughts."
p. 47 -- The place of documentary realism: "These unique "local cults" engendered by literary works are a typical feature of the second half of the eighteenth century, and gave evidence of a certain reorientation of the artistic image with respect to actual reality. It was as though the artistic image felt an organic striving for attachment to a particular time and, more importantly, to a particular concrete and graphically visible position in space. Here it is not a matter of how artistically realistic the image may be in and of itself (which, of course, in no way requires a precise geographical determination, a "nonfictitious" place of action). In this epoch the image typically conveys a direct geographical reality, and it strives not so much for internal verisimilitude as for an idea of it as an event that actually occurred, that is, in real time (and hence an attitude toward the artistic image of man as a living person, which is especially typical of sentimentalism, and the artistically deliberate "naive realism" of the image and of its perception by the public). The relationship of the artistic image to the new, geographically and historically concrete, graphically presented world is manifest here in an elementary, but still clear and graphic, form. These "local cults" attest above all to a completely new sense of space and time in the artistic work."
p. 50 -- "The locality became an irreplaceable part of the geographically and historically determined world, of that completely real and essentially visible world of human history, and the event became an essential and nontransferable moment in the time of this particular human history that occurred in this, and only in this, geographically determined human world."
The Problem of Speech Genres (pp. 60-102)
p. 63 -- "To ignore the nature of the utterance or to fail to consider the peculiarities of generic subcategories of speech in any area of linguistic study leads to perfunctoriness and excessive abstractness, distorts the historicity of the research, and weakens the link between language and life. After all, language enters life through concrete utterances (which manifest language) and life enters language through concrete utterances as well. The utterance is an exceptionally important node of problems."
p. 65 -- Genres change over time: "Historical changes in language styles are inseparably linked to changes in speech genres. Literary language is a complex, dynamic system of linguistic styles. The proportions and interrelations of these styles in the system of literary language are constantly changing. Literary language, which also includes nonliterary styles, is an even more complex system, and it is organized on different bases. In order to puzzle out the complex historical dynamics of these systems and move from a simple (and, in the majority of cases, superficial) description of styles, which are always in evidence and alternating with one another, to a historical explanation of these changes, one must develop a special history of speech genres (and not only secondary, but also primary ones) that reflects more directly, clearly, and flexibly all the changes taking place in social life."
p. 65-6 -- Literary ages defined by dominant genres: "In each epoch certain speech genres set the tone for the development of literary language. And these speech genres are not only secondary (literary, commentarial, and scientific), but also primary (certain types of oral dialogue-of the salon, of one's own circle, and other types as well, such as familiar, family-everyday, sociopolitical, philosophical, and so on). Any expansion of the literary language that re-stilts from drawing on various extraliterary strata of the national Ianguage inevitably entails some degree of penetration into all genres of written language (literary, scientific, commentarial, conversational, and so forth) to a greater or lesser degree, and entails new generic devices for the construction of the speech whole, its finalization, the accommodation of the listener or partner, and so forth. This leads to a more or less fundamental restructuring and renewal of speech genres." -- [the primary change literary language undergoes is the absorbtion of extraliterary genres]
p. 69 -- Active nature of understanding: "Thus, all real and integral understanding is actively responsive, and constitutes nothing other than the initial preparatory stage of a response (in whatever form it may he actualized). And the speaker himself is oriented precisely toward such an actively responsive understanding."
p. 71 -- "The boundaries of each concrete utterance as a unit of speech communication are determined by a change of speaking subjects, that is, a change of speakers. Any utterance-from a short (single-word) rejoinder in everyday dialogue to the large novel or scientific treatise-has, so to speak, an absolute beginning and an absolute end: its beginning is preceded by the utterances of others, and its end is followed by the responsive utterances of others (or, although it may be silent, others' active responsive understanding, or, finally, a responsive action based on this understanding)."
pp. 75-6 -- "The work, like the rejoinder in dialogue, is oriented toward the response of the other (others), toward his active responsive understanding, which can assume various forms: educational influence on the readers, persuasion of them, critical responses, influence on followers and successors, and so on. It can determine others' responsive positions under the complex conditions of speech communication in a particular cultural sphere. The work is a link in the chain of speech communion. Like the rejoinder in a dialogue, it is related to other work-utterances: both those to which it responds and those that respond to it. At the same time, like the rejoinder in a dialogue, it is separated from them by the absolute boundaries created by a change of speaking subjects."
p. 76 -- "The finalization of the utterance is, if you will, the inner side of the change of speech subjects. This change can only take place because the speaker has said (or written) everything he wishes to say at a particular moment or under particular circumstances."
pp. 76-7 -- "This finalized wholeness of the utterance, guaranteeing the possibility of a response (or of responsive understanding), is determined by three aspects (or factors) that are inseparably linked in the organic whole of the utterance: 1. semantic exhaustiveness of the theme; 2. the speaker's plan or speech will; 3. typical compositional and generic forms of finalization."
p. 77 -- "Here one can speak only of a certain minimum of finalization making it possible to occupy a responsive position. We do not objectively exhaust the subject, but, by becoming the theme of the utterance (i.e., of a scientific work) the subject achieves a relative finalization under certain conditions, when the problem is posed in a particular way, on the basis of particular material, with particular aims set by the author, that is, already within the boundaries of a specific authorial intent."
pp. 77-8 -- "Therefore, the immediate participants in communication, orienting themselves with respect to the situation and the preceding utterances, easily and quickly grasp the speaker's speech plan, his speech will. And from the very beginning of his words they sense the developing whole of the utterance."
p. 78 -- "The speaker's speech will is manifested primarily in the choice of a particular speech genre. This choice is determined by the specific nature of the given sphere of speech communication, semantic (thematic) considerations, the concrete situation of the speech communication, the personal composition of its participants, and so on. And when the speaker's speech plan with all its individuality and subjectivity is applied and adapted to a chosen genre, it is shaped and developed within a certain generic form."
p. 80 -- Mastery of communication = mastery of genre: "The better our command of genres, the more freely we employ them, the more fully and clearly we reveal our own individuality in them (where this is possible and necessary), the more flexibly and precisely we reflect the unrepeatable situation of communication-in a word, the more perfectly we implement our free speech plan."
p. 82 -- "... the main criterion for the finalization of the utterance as a true unit of speech communication: the capability of determining the active responsive position of the other participants in the communication."
p. 89 -- "Thus, the expressiveness of individual words is not inherent in the words themselves as units of language, nor does it issue directly from the meaning of these words: it is either typical generic expression or it is an echo of another's individual expression, which makes the word, as it were, representative of another's whole utterance from a particular evaluative position."
p. 91 -- "Each utterance is filled with echoes and reverberations of other utterances to which it is related by the communality of the sphere of speech communication. Every utterance must be regarded primarily as a response to preceding utterances of the given sphere (we understand the word "response" here in the broadest sense)."
p. 92 -- "The expression of an utterance always responds to a greater or lesser degree, that is, it expresses the speaker's attitude toward others' utterances and not just his attitude toward the object of his utterance."
p. 94 -- "From the very beginning, the speaker expects a response from them, an active responsive understanding. The entire utterance is constructed, as it were, in anticipation of encountering this response."
p. 97 -- "But the most complex and ultra-composite work of a secondary genre as a whole (viewed as a whole) is a single integrated real utterance that has a real author and real addressees whom this author perceives and imagines."
p. 99 -- "Thus, addressivity, the quality of turning to someone, is a constitutive feature of the utterance; without it the utterance does not and cannot exist."
p. 100 -- "A stylistic analysis that embraces all aspects of style is possible only as an analysis of the whole utterance, and only in that chain of speech communion of which the utterance is an inseparable link."
The Problem of the Text in Linguistics, Philology, and the Human Sciences: An Experiment in Philosophical Analysis (pp. 103-31)
p. 106 -- "But the text (as distinct from the language as a system of means) can never be completely translated, for there is no potential single text of texts."
p. 110 -- "To express oneself means to make oneself an object for another and for oneself ("the actualizing of consciousness" ). This is the first step in objectification. But it is also possible to reflect our attitude toward ourselves as objects (second stage of objectification). In this case, our own discourse becomes an object and acquires a second-its own-voice. But this second voice no longer casts (from itself) a shadow, for it expresses pure relationship and all the objectifying, materializing flesh of the word is imparted to the first voice."
p. 112 -- "When there is a deliberate (conscious) multiplicity of styles, there are always dialogic relations among the styles.' One cannot understand these interrelations purely linguistically (or even mechanically)."
p. 112 -- "The depiction of a thing and the depiction of a person (the speaker in his essence). Realism frequently reifies man, but this is not an approach to him. Naturalism, with its tendency toward a causal explanation of man's acts and thoughts (his semantic position in the world) reifies man even more. The "inductive" approach, which is assumed to be inherent in realism, is, in essence, a reifying causal explanation of man. The voices (in the sense of reified social styles) are thus simply transformed into signs of things (or symptoms of processes); it is no longer possible to respond to them, one can no longer polemicize with them, and dialogic relations with such voices fade away."
p. 115 -- "The author of a literary work (a novel) creates a unified and whole speech work (an utterance). But he creates it from heterogeneous, as it were, alien, utterances."
p. 116 -- "The author cannot be separated from the images and characters, since he enters into these images as an indispensable part of them (images are dual and sometimes double-voiced). But the image of the author can be separated from the images of the characters. This image itself, however, is created by the author and is therefore also dual. It is frequently as though the images of characters had been replaced by living people."
p. 116 -- "The characters speak as participants in the depicted life, as it were, from private positions. Their viewpoints are limited in one way or another (they know less than the author does). The author is outside the world depicted (and, in a certain sense, created) by him. He interprets this entire world from higher and qualitatively different positions. Finally, all characters and their speech are objects of an authorial attitude (and authorial speech). But the planes of the characters' speech and that of the authorial speech can intersect, that is, dialogic relations are possible between them."
p. 121 -- "The narrow understanding of dialogism as argument, polemics, or parody. These are the externally most obvious, but crude, forms of dialogism. Confidence in another's word, reverential reception (the authoritative word), apprenticeship, the search for and mandatory nature of deep meaning, agreement, its infinite gradations and shadings (but not its logical limitations and not purely referential reservations), the layering of meaning upon meaning, voice upon voice, strengthening through merging (hut not identification), the combination of many voices (a corridor of voices) that augments understanding, departure beyond the limits of the understood, and so forth. These special relations can be reduced neither to the purely logical nor to the purely thematic. Here one encounters integral positions, integral personalities (the personality does not require extensive disclosure-it can be articulated in a single sound, revealed in a single word), precisely voices."
p. 126 -- Superaddressee: "But in addition to this addressee (the second party), the author of the utterance, with a greater or lesser awareness, presupposes a higher superaddressee (third), whose absolutely just responsive understanding is presumed, either in some metaphysical distance or in distant historical time (the loophole addressee). In various ages and with various understandings of the world, this superaddressee and his ideally true responsive understanding assume various ideological expressions (God, absolute truth, the court of dispassionate human conscience, the people, the court of history, science, and so forth)."
From Notes Made in 1970-71 (pp. 132-158)p. 136 -- "The second consciousness and metalanguage. Metalanguage is not simply a code; it always has a dialogic relationship to the language it describes and analyzes."
p. 139 -- "Enclosure within the most immediate historical epoch. The lack of definition (methodological) of the very category of the epoch. We explain a phenomenon in terms of its own present and the recent past (within the limits of the "epoch"). What we foreground is the ready-made and finalized. Even in antiquity we single out what is ready-made and finalized, and not what has originated and is developing. We do not study literature's preliterary embryos (in language and ritual)."
p. 144 -- "The first task is to understand the work as the author himself understood it, without exceeding the limits of his understanding. This is a very difficult problem and usually requires introducing an immense amount of material.The second task is to take advantage of one's own position of temporal and cultural outsideness. Inclusion in our (other's for the author) context."
p. 151 -- "The utopian belief in the possibility of a purely internal path for transforming life into paradise."
p. 151 -- "Only a polyphonist like Dostoevsky can sense in the struggle of opinions and ideologies (of various epochs) an incomplete dialogue on ultimate questions (in the framework of great time). Others deal with issues that have been resolved within the epoch.The journalist is above all a contemporary. He is obliged to be one. He lives in the sphere of questions that can be resolved in the present day (or in any case in the near future). He participates in a dialogue that can be ended and even finalized, can be translated into action, and can become an empirical force. It is precisely in this sphere that 'one's own word' is possible. Outside this sphere 'one's own word' is not one's own (the individual personality always transcends itself); 'one's own word' cannot be the ultimate word."
p. 153 -- "Are there genres of pure self-expression (without the traditional authorial form)? Do there exist genres without an addressee?"
Towards a Methodology for the Human Sciences (p. 159ff.)
p. 170 -- "At any moment in the development of the dialogue there are immense, boundless masses of forgotten contextual meanings, but at certain moments of the dialogue's subsequent development along the way they are recalled and invigorated in renewed form (in a new context). Nothing is absolutely dead: every meaning will have its homecoming festival. The problem of great time."},

The interview analysis yields six areas in which literature plays a role in the field of AI: research focus, career choice, community formation, science communication, ethical thinking, and modelling of sociotechnical futures. These categories are proposed as the basis of a systematic taxonomy of the role of literature in AI research, evidencing literature’s significance in AI laboratory and professional cultures. The paper presents the results of this preliminary investigation in combination with a synthesis of existing evidence in each category of influence. The aim of this hybrid approach is to cohere research and evidence in this relatively new area of study, and to present new findings contextually, in order to provide the foundations for further qualitative and quantitative research.},

Introduction
1 – “Between the 1960s and the 1980s, computing technology underwent a dramatic transformation: the computer, originally conceived as an isolated calculating device, was reborn as a means of communication.”
2 – “The network was not originally to be a medium for interpersonal communication; it was intended to allow scientists to overcome the difficulties of running programs on remote computers. The current commercially run, communication-oriented Internet emerged only after a long process of technical, organizational, and political restructuring.”
5 - “Their dual role as users and producers led the ARPANET’s builders to adopt a new paradigm for managing the evolution of the system: rather than centralize design authority in a small group of network managers, they deliberately created a system that allowed any user with the requisite skill and interest to propose a new feature.”
1 White Heat and Cold War: The Origins and Meaning of Packet Switching
7 – “Indeed, one reason the ARPANET became the focus of so much attention with the computer science community was that it represented the first large-scale demonstration of the feasibility of packet-switching.”
2 Building the ARPANET
46 – “Roberts envisioned the ARPANET as a way to bring researchers together. He stressed early on that ‘a network would forst the “community” use of computers’. ‘Cooperative programming’, he continued, ‘would be stimulated, and in particular fields or disciplines it will be possible to achieve a “critical mass” of talent by allowing geographically separated people to effectively in interaction with a system’.” – Abbate quotes Larry Roberts ‘Multiple Computer Networks and Intercomputer Communciation’ (1967).
60-61 – The IMPs: “An IMP would receive data from hosts in the form of ‘messages’ that contained up to 8096 bits. The IMP would break up these messages to fit into packets of about 1000 bits, then add to each packet a standard header containing the packet’s source and destination addresses and some control information that could be used to check for transmission errors.”
74 – The importance of Requests for Comment and the Network Working Group: “RFCs enabled the NWG to evolve formal standards informally.”
80 – Abstraction and simulation in the Internet: “These strategies had lasting implications. ARPA did not invent the idea of layering; however, the ARPANET’s success popularized layering as a networking technique and made one particular version of layering a prominent model for builders of other networks. The ARPANET also influenced the design of computers by highlighting the difficulties that existing machines encountered in a networked environment and offering some solutions.”
3 “The Most Neglected Element”: Users Transform the ARPANET
109 – “Why then was the popularity of email such as surprise? One answer is that it represented a radical shift in the ARPANET’s identity and purpose.”
122 – Origins of IP: “In the spring of 1973, Kahn approached Vinton Cerf (then at Stanford University) with the idea of developing a system of internetworking. Cerf and Kahn had worked together on testing the first ARPANET node at UCLA, and Cerf had been one of the original designers of the ARPANET host protocol, so Kahn felt that Cerf was the right person to turn to for help.”
128 – “To connect the networks physically, Cerf and Kahn proposed the creation of special host computers called ‘gateways’. A gateway would be connected to two or more networks and would pass packets between them; all inter-network traffic would flow through these gateways.”
Civilian internet:
142 – Step one towards a civilian internet: “One step was to segregate the ARPANET’s military users and its academic researchers, who has been coexisting somewhat unueasilty since the DCA’s takeover of the ARPANET in 1975” – ARPANET/MILNET split in 1982-83 (p. 143)
143 – “The second step was to commercialize the Internet technology. […] by 1990 TCP/IP was available for virtually every computer on the American market.”
5 International Standards
X.25, OSI etc.
6 Popularizing the Internet
186 – A new dynamic of expansion in the 1980s: “Most of the explosive growth of the Internet during the latter half of the 1980s came not from an expansion of the ARPANET itself but from the growing number of networks that were attached to it.”
189 – “In the early 1980s, as the number of hosts and networks on the Internet began to rise, the original naming system showed signs of strain. Each host computer on the Internet has both a name (a set of characters—often a recognisable word—that can be used to refer to the host) and a numerical address (used by the network to identify the host).” At first, networks kept large “host tables” on file, but these began to explode and it was difficult for individual networks to handle. So… “To address this issue, members of the Internet technical community began discusssing the idea of dividing the Internet name space into a set of smaller ‘domains’.”
195 – ARPANET’s demise: “During 1988 and 1989, the various ARPA contract sites transferred their host connections from the ARPANET to the NSFNET. On 28 February 1990 the ARPANET was formally decommissioned and the remaining hardware dismantled.”
203 – Significance of WELL, CompuServe, AOL, Prodigy: “This non-networked form of online service, now largely forgotten, was instrumental in introducing large numbers of users to the practice of accessing information and interacting with other people via a distant computer.”
209 – The global picture: “Starting in the 1970s, many other nations built large data networks, which were shaped by their local cultures and which often served as agents and symbols of economic development and national sovereignty. The question was not whether these countries would adopt an ‘American’ technology; it was whether and how they would connect their existing national or private networks to the Internet.”
*212 – “Since the Internet originated in the United States, its ‘native language’ is English—a fact that has caused some resentment among other linguistic groups.”
*212 – “The Internet, as a medium of instantaneous communication, might overcome geographic distance, but it cannot simply erase political or social difference.”
214 – Building the web: “Berners-Lee planned to create a hypertext system that would link files located on computers around the world, forming a ‘world wide web’ of information. To the idea of hypertext he added the use of multimedia: his system included not only text-based information but also images, and later versions would add audio and video.”
215 – “An important feature of the URL was that it could refer to a variety of protocols, not just HTTP. This would make it possible to use the Web to access older Internet services, such as FTP, gopher, WAIS, and Usenet news.”
216 – Difference between Minitel and the Internet/WWW: “But Minitel did not allow users to create their own content—a distinctive feature of the World Wide Web.”

My reasons for those choices would, furthermore, have been very nearly the same as his, for we share numerous concerns and convictions. But, as I moved away from the starting point that body of literature provides, I would quite early have turned in a direction different from Boyd's, following a path that would have brought me quickly to a central metaphorlike process in science, one which he passes by. That path I shall have to sketch, if sense is to be made of my reactions to Boyd's proposals, and my remarks will therefore take the form of an excessively condensed epitome of parts of a position of my own, comments on Boyd's paper emerging along the way. That format seems all the more essential inasmuch as detailed analysis of individual points presented by Boyd is not likely to make sense to an audience largely ignorant of the causal theory of reference.Boyd begins by accepting Black's “interaction” view of metaphor. However metaphor functions, it neither presupposes nor supplies a list of the respects in which the subjects juxtaposed by metaphor are similar.},

	doi = {10.1017/CBO9781139173865.022},
	abstract = {Analogy and metaphor are central to scientific thought. They figure in discovery, as in Rutherford's analogy of the solar system for the atom or Faraday's use of lines of magnetized iron filings to reason about electric fields (Nersessian, 1984; Tweney, 1983). They are also used in teaching: novices are told to think of electricity as analogous to water flowing through pipes (Gentner \&amp; Gentner, 1983) or of a chemical process as analogous to a ball rolling down a hill (Van Lehn \&amp; J. S. Brown, 1980). Yet for all its usefulness, analogical thinking is never formally taught to us. We seem to think of it as a natural human skill, and of its use in science as a straightforward extension of its use in commonsense reasoning. For example, William James believed that “men, taken historically, reason by analogy long before they have learned to reason by abstract characters” (James, 1890, vol. II, p. 363). All this points to an appealing intuition: that a faculty for analogical reasoning is an innate part of human cognition, and that the concept of a sound, inferentially useful analogy is universal.In this essay we question this intuition. We analyze the way in which analogy and metaphor have been used at different points in the history of Western scientific thought, tracing their use backward from the present time. We begin by laying out the current framework for analogical reasoning, followed by two examples that conform to the modern aesthetic, those of Sadi Carnot (1796–1832) and Robert Boyle (1627–1691).},

An important challenge for these accounts is explaining how abstract concepts, which do not directly call upon sensory or motor information, can be informed by experience. We propose that metaphor is one important vehicle guiding the development and use of abstract concepts. Metaphors allow us to draw on concrete, familiar domains to acquire and reason about abstract concepts. Additionally, repeated metaphoric use drawing on particular aspects of concrete experience can result in the development of new abstract representations. These abstractions, which are derived from embodied experience but lack much of the sensorimotor information associated with it, can then be flexibly applied to understand new situations.},

In this paper we analyze three case studies in which a literal reading of each program’s code is effectively nonsense. In their performance, however, the programs generate meaning. To discern this meaning, we use the framework of nonmaterial performance (NMP), which is based on four tenets: code abstracts, code performs, code acts within a network, and code is vibrant. We begin with what is to our knowledge the oldest example of nonsense code: a program (now lost) from the 1950s that caused a Univac 1 computer to hum “Happy Birthday”. Second, we critique Firestarter, a processor stress test from the Technical University of Dresden. Finally, we analyze one of the family of processor power side-channel attacks known collectively as Platypus. In each case, the text of the code is a wholly unreliable guide to its extra-textual significance. This paper builds on work in Critical Code Studies by bringing in methodologies from actor-network theory and political science, examining code from a performance-studies perspective and with expertise from computer science. Code can certainly be read as literature, but ultimately it is text written to be performed. Imagining and observing the performance forces the critic to engage with the code in its own network. The three examples we have chosen to critique here are outliers---very little code in the world is purposed to manipulate the physical machine. Nonsense shows us the opportunity that nonmaterial performance creates: to decenter text from privileged position and to recenter code as a performance.},

We then verify this map through case studies of two popular GPT-2 applications: the text adventure game, AI Dungeon, and the language art project, This Word Does Not Exist. Such an exercise allows us to test the potential of Critical Code Studies when the object of study is deep learning code and to demonstrate the validity of code as an analytical focus for researchers in the subfields of Critical Artificial Intelligence and Critical Machine Learning Studies. More broadly, however, our work draws attention to the means by which ordinary users might interact with, and even direct, the behavior of deep learning systems, and by extension works toward demystifying some of the auratic mystery of “AI.” What is at stake is the possibility of achieving an informed sociotechnical consensus about the responsible applications of large language models, as well as a more expansive sense of their creative capabilities — indeed, understanding how and where engagement occurs allows all of us to become more active participants in the development of machine learning systems.},

Introduction : the computer as a mode of mediation
12-13 – Argument that computers are profile-driven: A. “Objects are never humans to a computer.” (12) B. “Profiles, not personas, drive the computer.” (12) C. “The world no longer indicates to us what it is. We indicate ourselves to it, and in doing so the world materializes in our image.” (13)
17 – Computers are textual: “Subsequent to television, which began a retreat away from optical media and a return to the symbolic in the form of signal codification, the computer consummates the retreat from the realm of the imaginary to the purely symbolic realm of writing.” {\textless}-- classic example of ‘materialist’ reductivism in this kind of writing. The TV is ‘non-visual’ because the television signal is invisible before it is decoded by the box.
19 – “One hears stories about computers being ‘definitional’ machines: not only does computer code operate through definitions of states and state changes, but computers themselves are those special machines that nominalize the world, that define and model its behavior using variables and functions.” {\textless}-- A. this reduces all computer programs to their representation as a finite-state machine; B. it limits the contents of (encoded) programs to ‘variables’ and ‘functions’… sigh
22-23 – Idea of computers as ethical rather than ontological: “The computer instantiates a practice not a presence, an effect not an object. In other words, if cinema is, in general, an ontology, the computer is, in general, an ethic.” (22) “The machine is an ethic because it is premised on the notion that objects are subject to definition and manipulation according to a set of principles for action.” {\textless}-- compare to Sussmann/Abelson’s view that computing is ‘procedural’ rather than ‘declarative’ knowledge
The unworkable interface
25 – “Frames, windows, doors, and other thresholds are those transparent devices that achieve more the less they do: for every moment of virtuosic immersion and connectivity, for every moment of volumetric delivery, of inopacity, the threshold becomes one notch more invisible, one notch more inoperable.” {\textless}-- But doors and windows aren’t transparent… They can be shut as well as closed… and frames can be ostentatious as well as inconspicuous…
30 – Interface as keyword: “New media foreground the interface like never before.”
42 – Example of WoW interface: “Here the interface is awash in information. Even someone unfamiliar with the game will notice that the nondiegetic portion of the interface is as important if not more so than the diegetic portion. Gauges and dials have superseded lenses and windows.”
44 – Flaw in traditional theory of the interface: “Politics thus reveals why the door or window theory of the interface is inadequate. The door-window model, handed down from McLuhan, can only ever reveal one thing, that the interface is a palimpsest. It can only ever reveal that the interface is a reprocessing of some other media that came before.” {\textless}-- ‘only ever’? Galloway never hedges.
46-51 – Typology of aesthetics and politics, both of which can be ‘incoherent’ or ‘coherent’, producing four possible modes of politico-aesthetic activity. {\textless}-- Interestingly, his definition of “Truth” as “an aesthetic of incoherence, a politics of incoherence” is remarkably similar to Iris Murdoch’s use of “truth” as an aesthetic concept.
52 – “In short, ideology gets modeled in software.”
Software and ideology
55 – Hui Kyong Chun’s theory: “One of the first claims extracted from Chun is that there is a similarity, which we may call a formal similarity, between the structure of ideology and the structure of software.”
59 – There is no distinction between users and programmers today: “The detailed forms of algorithmic interaction and play required today of the computer-using public is, in my mind, so exactly akin to writing code that the division between the two must certainly be ascribed to other ends.”
59-60 – Analysis of Kittler’s “The Is No Software,” which seems to be the origin-point of Galloway/Tenen’s materialist reductivist account of computing.
*64 – The central principle: modelling = obfuscation. “Software operates through a technological model that places a great premium on meticulous symbolic declaration and descriptions, yet at the same time requires concealment, encapsulation, and obfuscation of large portions of code. … Formulated as an assertion, software requires both reflection and obfuscation.” {\textless}-- he takes the term ‘reflection’ from OOP, but either doesn’t understand OOP or freely stretches the meaning. He thinks ‘reflection’ has to do with the syntactic rules of the language, rather than the runtime visibility of object classes.
He basically spends the next few pages trying to argue that software stops you peeking under the hood. It’s not a terrible idea, but he lards it with so many factual errors and silly uses of the adverb ‘always’ that it becomes very annoying.
65 – Hacking software is different to hacking language: “Of course, this does not foreclose the possibility, nay necessity, for hacks and other software exploits to pop up in the complexity of the software network, exploits which can never be predicted, as the computer scientists would say, ‘statically’. The difference is that exploits operate intensively within and through the rules of the symbolic system, while natural languages operate extensively as a result of a combinatorial discursive logic ever intent of probing the boundaries of allowable style.”
66 – A classic example of his factual slapdashery: “Even the HTML example referenced previously uses the same principle of data hiding: HTML is never shown in the browser window, it is always parsed and converted from ASCII text into a graphical layout (which may or may not also include ASCII text).” {\textless}-- Some problems: A. Unicode, not ASCII (no big deal); B. HTML is shown when you ‘view source’. C. HTML is shown when you ‘inspect element’. D. HTML is shown if there is an error (e.g. doctype is wrong, so interpreted as xml). E. HTML is shown when it is typed ‘literally’ into the source of the document, e.g. on a site such as W3Schools that explains HTML.
Underlying this example is a fundamental flaw in Galloway’s method, which is highly normative. He very strictly defines the proper functioning of a system, then grandly goes on about what that proper functioning excludes. Two problems: (1) We all know that proper functioning only partly explains the behavior of a system int he real world, and a humanistic critique of the system requires us to consider its actual use. (2) His definition of proper functioning is far too narrow, indeed it becomes so narrow that it contradicts itself. HTML is supposed to be read in its raw form too – it is a human-readable representation of a document/interface. Otherwise it would be unprogrammable. If it is supposed to be hidden, then this makes a mockery of Galloway’s earlier attack on the distinction between the user and the programmer.
68 – Encapsulation of objects in OOP is the same as commodity fetishism in Marx’s theory. (!)
68 – Critique of open source: “Open source software follows the principle of source concealment, just as proprietary software does. Hence it is not the ability to view the  source that is at question, but whether or not the source is put front and center as the medium itself.” {\textless}-- There is a good point and a bad point here. Bad point: that open source software is never actually ‘open sourced’. Good point: the source is not always the really crucial thing.
71 – Galloway rejects the entire ‘code as communication’ movement: “Yet I agree with Hayles: code is machinic first and linguistic second; an intersubjective infrastructure is not the same as a material one …” {\textless}-- He doesn’t address the tension between this argument and his ‘code is ideology’ argument. 
74 – Code is representation without ‘figuration’: “It is representation in form, but not in deed, and this is the paradox. It is representation as mathematical recoding, not as any socially or culturally significant process of figuration, yet at the end of the day what emerges is exactly that.” {\textless}-- Argh! A program ≠ its encoding in the inner state of the processor…
Are some things unrepresentable?

It shows how the two concepts are related, difference implying divergence and decentring, repetition being associated with displacement and disguising.

	shorttitle = {Cosmpolitan {Dreams}},
	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In late nineteenth-century South Asia, the arrival of print fostered a dynamic and interactive literary culture. There, within the pages of Urdu-language periodicals and newspapers, readers found a public sphere that not only catered to their interests but encouraged their reactions to featured content. \textit{Cosmopolitan Dreams} brings this culture to light, showing how literature became a site in which modern daily life could be portrayed and satirized, the protocols of modernity challenged, and new futures imagined.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}
{\textless}p{\textgreater}Drawing on never-before-translated Urdu fiction and prose and focusing on the novel and satire, Jennifer Dubrow shows that modern Urdu literature was defined by its practice of self-critique and parody. Urdu writers resisted the cultural models offered by colonialism, creating instead a global community of imagination in which literary models could freely circulate and be readapted, mixed, and drawn upon to develop alternative lines of thinking. Highlighting the participation of readers and writers from diverse social and religious backgrounds, the book reveals an Urdu cosmopolis where lively debates thrived in newspapers, literary journals, and letters to the editor, shedding fresh light on the role of readers in shaping vernacular literary culture. Arguing against current understandings of Urdu as an exclusively Muslim language, Dubrow demonstrates that in the late nineteenth century, Urdu was a cosmopolitan language spoken by a transregional, transnational community that eschewed identities of religion, caste, and class.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}
{\textless}p{\textgreater}The Urdu cosmopolis pictured here was soon fractured by the forces of nationalism and communalism. Even so, Dubrow is able to establish the persistence of Urdu cosmopolitanism into the present and shows that Urdu’s strong tradition as a language of secular, critical modernity did not end in the late nineteenth century but continues to flourish in film, television, and on line. In lucid prose, Dubrow makes the dynamic world of colonial Urdu print culture come to life in a way that will interest scholars of modern Asian literatures, South Asian literature and history, cosmopolitanism, and the history of print culture.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

p. 3 – "Meaning" and "pattern": "When a system of 'meaningless' symbols has patterns that accurately track, or mirror, various phenomena in the world, then that tracking or mirroring imbues the symbols with some degree of meaning — indeed, such tracking or mirroring is no less and no more than what meaning is."
pp. 3-4 – Meaning is not created by the "stuff" that brains are made of, but by the "patterns" that exist in brains and in the universe.
p. 12 – An interesting note on his writing of the book: "One of the key qualities that made me so believe in what I was doing is that this was a book in which form was being given equal billing with content — and that was no accident, since GEB is in large part about how content is inseperable from form, how semantics is of a piece with syntax, how inextricable pattern and matter are from one another."
PART I
Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering
p. 9 – During H's discussion of JSB's "Musikalisches Opfer," he defines an "isomorphism," which is an "information-preserving transformation" – he uses the various transformations Bach performs on themes in a canon to illustrate this concept – e.g. when you invert a theme, it obviously changes, but you can reconstruct the original theme, so all the information is preserved.
p. 10 – H uses Bach's "rising canon" to illustrate a "strange loop." This canon begins in C and imperceivably modulates to D. If you play it again, you go up to E, etc. After six more repetitions, you're back at C (though an octave higher)! A "strange loop" results when moving through the levels of a hierarchical system, you end up back where you started. – H also calls this a "tangled hierarchy"
Some of Escher's drawings contain strange loops – the monks who forever go down by walking up stairs etc. – A conflict between the finite and infinite.
Russel's paradox is a strange loop.
p. 26 – The problem with minds/computers: "Computers by their very nature are the most inflexible, desireless, rule-following of beasts. Fast though they may be, they are nonetheless the epitome of unconsciousness. How, then, can intelligent behavior be programmed? Isn't this the most blatent of contradictions in terms? One of the major theses of this book is to urge each reader to confront the apparent contradiction head on, to savor it, to turn it over, to take it apart, to wallow in it, so that in the end the reader might emerge with new insights into the seemingly unbreachable gulf between the formal and the informal, the animate and the inanimate, the flexible and the inflexible.
This is what Artificial Intelligence (AI) is all about. And the strange flavor of AI work is that people try to put together long sets of rules in strict formalisms which tell inflexible machines how to be flexible."
p. 28 – A nice aside on conversational form in the C18th: "Bach himself used to remind his pupils that the separate parts in their compositions should behave like 'persons who conversed together as if in a select company'."
Three-Part Invention
Achilles and the Tortise – Zeno's paradox of motion.
Chapter 1: The MU-Puzzle
p. 37f. – One ability of humans – to perceive the "system," and jump in or out of if. – Of course, life is messy, and in most contexts, there is not real boundary between "systems."
Two-Part Invention (actually, Lewis Carrol's "Achilles and the Tortise")Pretty genius.
Chapter 2: Meaning and Form in Mathematics
pp. 49-51 – Isomorphisms produce meaning. We "interpret" something when we perceive a hidden structure in it (i.e. an "isomorphism" between the apparently meaningless symbols and a hidden order that gives them meaning).
pp. 50-1 – Why mathematicians use formal systems: "The idea of these people is to set up a formal system whose theorems reflect some portion of reality isomorphically."
[Here we go – topic modelling produces a bag of words according to a formal process, and we perceive an "isopmorphism" between them and reality. What aspect of reality can be described using the patterns identified by the model? One historian suggests "discourses." I prefer the term "vocabularies." – Topic modelling derives from a "formal system" or algorithm itself: Bayesian probability.]
p. 53 – "When different aspects of the real world are isomorphic to each other (in this case, additions and subtractions), one single formal system can be isomorphic to both..."
p. 53 – H demonstrates using his "pq" system how a very simple system can imitate part of reality, in this case addition. This raises a question: "Can all of reality be turned into a formal system?" – [This question is identical to "is determinism true?"]
Sonata for Achilles
Chapter 3: Figure and Ground
A simple enough distinction at first, but H goes on to discuss "recursive" figures, where we can see either element as figure or ground (e.g. ambigrams), and "figure-figure" situations, where the two elements of the image can be considered either as the ground to the other's figure, or as copies of one another. This situation, in a word, is negation. – Bach's music as example of recursion, since all the "harmonies" are also melodies.
All in context of trying to design a typographic rule to produce prime numbers.
Ultimate problem: thinking about formal systems as figures... not all of them are recursive (in other words, the whole universe is not divided into the theorem and its negation.
...
Chapter 5: Recursive Structures and Processespp. 146-149 – Interesting discussion of what makes two things the "same." H notices that we constantly encounter "sameness-in-difference." At its vaguest, sameness seems to be a matter of "style." (Why does Bach always sound the same? Why do all of Escher's drawings look the same?) At its most precise, sameness seems to be a "mapping" of "functional parts" onto "functional parts." E.g. all humans (more or less) have a stomach. Our stomachs are different, of course, but they share a function, so are the "same."
Chapter 6: The Location of Meaning
The dialogue before this chapter is quite amusing – it involves a jukebox that contains only one record, but multiple record-players. When you choose a "song," a different record player is engaged to play the record, and interprets it differently.
p. 165 – H's theory of inherent meaning (which he think certain objects have): "Generally, we can say: meaning is part of an object to the extent that it acts upon intelligence in a predictable way." – E.g. If Chadwick hadn't deciphered Linear B, someone else would have, and would have arrived at the same answer.
H sets up a theory of the three levels of meaning. Every message has a "frame message" ("This is a message!"), an "outer message" ("These are the rules you use to interpret the message and get the information") and an "inner message" ("This is the message."). It's no use including any information in the message about what it is and how to interpret it, because you would have to interpret it in order to get the information about how to interpret it! Thus there must be "triggers" in the frame and outer messages, which enable intelligent beings to penetrate through to the inner message.
p. 170 – H explores some paradoxes of meaning. So solve them, he basically just becomes a Kantian. He deduces that the physical structure of our brains includes message-decoding "hardware," that enables us to break the paradox of inherent meaning and interpret the world around us. – p. 171: "Meaning is intrinsic if intelligence is natural."
Chapter 7: The Propositional Calculus
p. 196 – H dispenses with Popper's silly attack on Hegel's/Marx's dialectics. [H doesn't actually mention Hegel or Marx, but his argument quite simply steps over what Popper thought was an unanswerable logical objection to the concept of dialectical thought.] – First H shows that if you ever admit a contradiction in propositional logic, then your system will prove that literally any proposition is true: If P \& not P, then Q. And Q can be anything! But then this: "This does not sound much like human thought. If you found a contradiction in your own thoughts, it's very unlikely that your whole mentality would break down. Instead, you would probably begin to question the beliefs or modes of reasoning which you felt had led to the contradictory thoughts. In other words, to the extent you could, you would step out of the systems inside you which you felt were responsible for the contradiction, and try to repair them. One of the least likely things for you to do would be to throw up your arms and cry, "Well, I guess that shows that I believe everything now!" As a joke, yes—but not seriously." "Indeed, contradiction is a major source of clarification and progress in all domains of life—and mathematics is no exception."
Chapter 8: Typographical Number Theory
The dialogue to this chapter is pretty genius—it's a "crab canon," which is pretty much identical if you read the speaking parts forwards or backwards. (But not quite...)
H introduces typographical number theory, which is essentially a theory of natural numbers expressed typographically. Two problems: it seems possible both for a+0=a to be false (common sense) AND true (!) according to the system. And secondly, we don't know/haven't proven that TNT is consistent. – The first problem is the "Entscheidungsproblem," or incompleteness; the second is the problem of consistency. Basically, Gödel proved that we can't ever solve these problems in terms of TNT.
Chapter 9: Mumon and Gödel
Gödel's genius insight: p. 264 – "Typographical rules for manipulating numerals are actually arithmetical rules for operating on numbers." Every formal system can be expressed in number theory—the isomorphism always holds.
The next step: Since any theorem of any formal system can be expressed numerically, so can it be expressed in Typographical Number Theory (since there ought to be a perfect isomorphism between numbers \& TNT).
PART II: THE ETERNAL GOLDEN BRAID
Chapter 11: Brains and Thoughts
The opening dialogue is one of H's best. Very long, but densly interwoven, quite funny, with little ambigrams to illustrate his key ideas.
p. 337 – Trying to teach computers to think has opened up new perspectives on how humans do it. [This is exactly like trying to teach computers to interpret literature.]
Endless Hegelianism. During the dialogue, H wrote that "self-conciousness is essential to consciousness." On p. 352, he writes: "This idea that there is generality in the specific is of far reaching importance."
Chapter 12: Minds and Thoughts
The "dialogue" for this chapter is a presentation of Jabberwocky in English, French and German. Quite amusing. – The theme of the chapter is whether there exists isomorphisms between different people's minds—i.e. between brains on the "symbol" level.
H builds up an analogy about minds and discuss the problems of isomorphism. Every person in the USA has their own "Alternative Structure of the Union" (ASU) in their heads, which shares many features with the ASUs of other people, but is also different. Similarly, the Jabberwocky poems in different languages. The way "culture" impacts upon thought.
p. 384ff. – H now introduces his definition of consciousness/intelligence: the "I-subsystem" in the brain, that allows the system to describe itself. This is consciousness.
pp. 388-90 – H quotes from another philosopher (Lucas) who basically draws upon the same stock of ideas as H, but comes to a virtually opposite conclusion: Minds are in no way like machines. Minds are able to refer to themselves without paradox. They are Gödel-complete.
Chapter 13: BlooP and FlooP and GlooP
Dialogue: Funny play on the goldberg variations. A problem: We might know that there could be a solution g, but the test to find the value of g is potentially infinite. We will never know, for instance, whether we have found all of Bach's Goldberg variations—there could always be one more! The answer is finite (there are g variations), but the search is potentially infinite!
H introduces some made-up programming languages, then shows that it would be impossible to use them to calculate whether a "partial recursive" function (such as wondrousness) terminates or not. It is not possible to fold FlooP back on itself to test whether a function terminates w/o running it, potentially infinitely. He uses Cantor's diagonal argument to prove this.
Chapter 14: Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem
Dialogue: Another strange loop. A \& T play a game, where they "quine" sentences. To "quine" a sentence, you precede it by its quotation, e.g. "Is the name of Michael Falk" is the name of Michael Falk. As this sentence demonstrates, it is easy to introduce contradictions with this kind of game... most obviously: "When quined, yields a falsehood," when quined, yields a falsehood. Is sentence Q (the whole sentence) true or false?
H explains Gödel's argument—it's not easy to follow! On p. 452, he introduces a new concept. Gödel has proven that natural number theory is incomplete—i.e. there exist numbers outside it. What if we accepted the existence of these numbers as an axiom, and ran with it? Just like previous mathematicians did for negative numbers, rational numbers (fractions), irrational numbers and imaginary numbers? What would we find if we simply accepted that "supernatural" numbers existed, despite the fact that they lead to a contradiction of self-reference in natural number theory? [I refer to this, because it seems to me, again, to be such a Hegelian/dialectical way of looking at things! A contradiction emerges from within a system (paradox of self-reference), leading to the creation of a new concept ("supernatural numbers") unthinkable within the old system. The old system is thus negated, preserved, and raised up...]
p. 454 – What are "supernatural numbers," in essence? Since they are derivable in TNT, supernatural numbers share all the properties of natural numbers. "This means, in particular, that supernatural numbers are not anything already familiar to you, such as fractions, or negative numbers, or complex numbers, or whatever. The supernatural numbers are, instead, best visualized as integers which are greater than all natural numbers—as infinitely large integers. Here is the point: althought theorems of TNT can rule out negative numbers, fractions, irrational numbers, and complex numbers, still there is not way to rule out infinitely large integers. The problem is, there is no way even to express the statement 'There are no infinite quantities'."
p. 456 – Problem: which system of arithmetic is "true," the standard or the non-standard? Well, both and neither. BUT THEN—A thought on the mathematical description of reality: "There is one argument which can be, and perhaps ought to be, raised against the preceding. Suppose experiments in the real, physical world can be explained more economically in terms of one particular version of geometry than in terms of any other. Then it might make sense to say that that geometry is 'true'. From the point of view of a physicist who wants to use the 'correct' geometry, then it makes some sense to distinguish between the 'true' geometry, and other geometries. But this cannot be taken too simplistically. Physicists are always dealing with approximations and idealizations of situations. For instance, in my own Ph.D. work, mentioend in Chapter V, was based on an extreme idealization of the problem of a crystal in a magnetic field. The mathematics which emerged was of a high degree of beauty and simplicity. Despite—or rather, because of—the artificiality of the model, some fundamental features emerged conspicuously in the graph. These features then suggest some guesses about the kinds of things that might happen in more realistic situations."—[This is reminiscent of Ramsay's arguments in "In Praise of Pattern" and Reading Machines.]
p. 457 – "Mathematics only tells you answers to questions in the real world after you have taken the one vital step of choosing which kind of mathematics to apply."
Chapter 15: Jumping out of the System
Dialogue: A funny variation, in which A tries to come up with infinite answer-schemas to get out of T's incessant questioning, but T can always invent a greater infinity. A tries to "jump out of the system," in other words, and seems to end up right back in it.
H explores the paradoxes of "jumping out"—however often you can do it, it is always conceivable that you can do it again. Our habitual assocation of "jumping out" with "objectivity."
Chapter 16: Self-Ref and Self-Rep
Dialogue: A goes over to C's house. C has a TV camera and a TV—they experiment with "self-engulfing," by aiming the camera at the TV screen where the camera's image is displayed. The Crab also has a number of paradoxical Magritte paintings, including the famous "Ceci n'est pas une pipe."
p. 499 – The secret of self-reproduction (basically the use-mention distinction again). H comes up with a notional program that reproduces itself: "Thus in this program, one string functions in two ways: first as program, as second as data. This is the secret of self-reproducing programs, and, as we shall see, of self-reproducing molecules."
H introduces an idealised system of genetics. He makes a fascinating point: Genes are acted on by enzymes, which chop them up, copy them etc.—but the enzymes themselves are defined by the genes! This is indeed a "tangled hierarchy." – p. 513 – Strands of DNA are thus simultaneously "data," shunted about by enzymes, and "programs," instructing the enzymes that shunt them!
p. 531 – Use-mention. H is talking about how DNA is "unzipped" and copied by enzymes which are themselves created by according to information encoded in genes: "There is a biochemical analogue to the use-mention dichotomy: when DNA is treated as a mere sequence of chemicals to be copied, it is like mention of typographical symbols; when DNA is dictating what operations shall be carried out, it is like use of typographical symbols."
p. 535 – A tour de force—H maps genetics, as a formal system, onto TNT. Fabulous analogy. In fact, he carefully designed TNT to have 20 symbols—and there are 20 kinds of amino acid! Genius. The question: What is the genetic equivalent of the incompleteness theorem? Given the system of genes, there must exist a possible gene that encodes its own destruction (or something like that).
H ends the chapter reflecting upon the incredible "confusion of levels" in biochemistry, and a question: how did it all begin? We have no answer... [But on the other hand, an answer seems likely, given the way levels of meaning seem to be constantly confused everywhere we look! NB: This has suddenly reminded me of Jameson's point that the true operation of literary form is "interference between levels."]
Chapter 17: Church, Turing, Tarski, and Others
Dialogue: A \& T meet the Crab. They speak in a funny backwards way at first. The Crab has a flute. He plays pieces which written in TNT. He finds pieces beautiful which are theorems of TNT, and ugly which are not theorems. But he is unaware that his musical notation is TNT, and resents A's suggestion that it is. In the end, A writes a piece which C doesn't want to play. [I assume it is an infinitely recursive theorem, so C could never know if it was beautiful or not.]
H introduces his overarching argument about the nature of intelligence: at bottom, it is computation. But we will never be able to describe it in terms of basic arithmetic, because of the extraordinary complexity of the system (billions of neurons reacting in complex ways to one another etc.). We will always have to "chunk" intelligence, and talk about it on a higher level. To test this idea, H tells the story of Ramanujan, a brilliant mathematician who worked in a famously unorthodox and intuitive manner (pp. 562-566). His closest collaborator, Hardy, nonetheless felt that however intuitive and original R's approach to mathematics, on a fundamental level he was still doing the same maths as everyone else. [Now we can see the point of Crab's musical abilities in the dialogue.] – He says that AI could really be "Artificial Imagery" or "Artificial Imagination."
This conviction that at bottom all maths is the same is basically the Turing-Church hypothesis.
[This all makes me think of the conclusion to Asimov's Foundation series, where Trevize is called upon to make an "intuitive" decision about the fate of the universe, and chooses Gaia.]
p. 568 – H makes some important points about the isomorphism of brains and computers straight out: He thinks that our ability to compute things is on a relatively high level, and asserts no isomorphism between the physical structure of the brain (neurons) and the basic structure of a computer (bits, bytes etc.).
p. 569f. – This isomorphism is obvious in the case of arithmetic, which is extremely easy to formalise/describe. But intelligence is about making sense of the real world, and the real world is exceedingly complex. Our intuitions/imagination allow us to process an apparently infinite amount of data, determining relevance etc.
p. 583 – H draws a distinction between the "syntactic" and "semantic" elements of meaning and form: "Thus, another way of characterizing the difference between 'syntactic' and 'semantic' properties (in the just-proposed sense) is that the syntactic ones reside unambiguously inside the object under consideration, whereas semantic properties depend on its relations with a potentially infinite class of other objects, and therefore are not completely localizable. There is nothing cryptic or hidden, in principle, in syntactic properties, whereas hiddenness is of the essence of semantic properties. That is the reason for my suggested distinction between 'syntactic' and 'semantic' aspects of visual form." – [Reminiscent of The Genesis of Secrecy...?]
Chapter 18: Artifical Intelligence: Retrospects
Dialogue: A funny dialogue about an intelligent young program who invites a student to come and try out its new human, which is capable of producing a running commentary on the intelligent program's actions.
pp. 623-5 – An interesting point H makes about a program he made. The program was capable of producing random sentences that were vaguely grammatical. Often they made sense, but usually not, and as a set clearly made none at all. They had no meaning. What they lacked, according to H, was "imagery," a coherent world-picture to which they corresponded. – [I think that Lakoff \& Johnson could be an interesting read on this point.]
pp. 626-7 – Even something apparently totally "formal," like music, has the same prerequisite of meaning: some relationship to the listener's world-picture.
Chapter 19: AI: Prospects
Dialogue: A, T and C go with their new friend Sloth to C's house. C has a special "subjunctive" television, that not only display what happens, but what might happen or have happened...
H's theory of the nature of intelligence/artificial intelligence – the ability flexibilty to notice and interpret patterns, using dense networks of concepts with many "ports of access" and relationships to one another. When he describes what AI might be like, well, it sounds like Frankenstein—it would necessarily be unpredictable, and there is no guarantee that AI would make any sense to us if we "spoke" with it!
