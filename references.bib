	abstract = {The growing influence of English Wikipedia as a provider of information has created powerful new gatekeepers and publishing practices that determine not only what constitutes knowledge in the online world, but whose knowledge is privileged. The structural inequalities of the offline world are being reproduced online, creating new sites for information imperialism. Research shows western contributors are overwriting local knowledge, perpetuating western narratives, and presenting cultures through an outsider lens, resulting in subtle and not so subtle forms of hegemonic cultural dominance. Nonetheless, Wikipedias have multi-media capabilities, which can be utilized by oral cultures as well as providing new asynchronous online meeting places where communities can continue their social imaginings. This paper considers the impacts of English Wikipedia on global knowledge equity and cognitive justice. It analyzes two articles about Bhutanese culture to demonstrate the risks of dilution brought by western ontological expansiveness, and argues that, by contrast, the Dzongkha Wikipedia offers an online space mostly inaccessible to outsiders, and thus a bulwark where the community can continue its cultural conversations in ways not possible before Web 2.0 technologies.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes the notion of temporal structuring as a way of understanding and studying time as an enacted phenomenon within organizations. It suggests that through their everyday action, actors produce and reproduce a variety of temporal structures which in turn shape the temporal rhythm and form of their ongoing practices. A focus on temporal structuring, combined with a practice perspective, allows the subjective-objective dichotomy that underlies much of the existing research on time in organizations to be bridged. After developing the notion of temporal structuring, the paper illustrates its use in the context of prior empirical study. The paper concludes by outlining some implications of temporal structuring for organizational research on time.},

	abstract = {In the last two decades, the Linked Open Data paradigm has been experiencing exponential growth. Regularly, new datasets and ontologies are made publicly available, and novel projects are initiated to stimulate their continuous development and reuse, pushing more and more actors to adhere to the Semantic Web principles. The guidelines provided by the Semantic Web community allow to (i) homogeneously represent, (ii) uniquely identify, and (iii) uniformly reference any piece of information. However, the same standards do not allow defining and referencing the methods to exploit it: functions, procedures, algorithms, and code in general, are left out of this interconnected world. In this paper, we present our vision for a Web with Linked Open Code in which functions could be accessed and used as Linked Data, allowing logic harnessing the latter to be semantically described and FAIRly accessible. Hereafter, we describe the challenges presented by the implementation of our vision. We propose first insights on how to concretize it, and we provide a non-exhaustive list of communities that could benefit from such an ideal.},

The result is a non-extensional theory of functions as rules of computation, contrasting with an extensional theory of functions as sets of ordered pairs. Despite its sparse syntax, the expressiveness and flexibility of the λ-calculus make it a cornucopia of logic and mathematics.

In addition, current research areas—such as parallelism, nondeterminism, input/output, and state-oriented computations—are examined with the goal of predicting the future development and application of functional languages.},

	abstract = {This paper surveys the evolution of “high-lever” programming languages during the first decade of computer programming activity. We discuss the contributions of Zuse in 1945 (the “Plankalkül”), Goldstine and von Neumann in 1946 (“Flow Diagrams”), Curry in 1948 (“Composition”), Mauchly et al. in 1949 (“Short Code”), Burks in 1950 (“Intermediate PL”), Rutishauser in 1951 (“Klammerausdrücke”), Böhm in 1951 (“Formules”), Glennie in 1952 (“AUTOCODE”), Hopper et al. in 1953 (“A-2”), Laning and Zierler in 1953 (“Algebraic Interpreter”), Backus et al. in 1954–1957 (“FORTRAN”), Brooker in 1954 (“Mark I AUTOCODE”), Kamynin and Lîubimskii in 1954 (“ΠΠ-2”), Ershov in 1955 (“ΠΠ”), Grems and Porter in 1955 (“BACAIC”), Elsworth et al. in 1955 (“Kompiler 2”), Blum in 1956 (“ADES”), Perlis et al. in 1956 (“IT”), Katz et al. in 1956–1958 (“MATH-MATIC”), Bauer and Samelson in 1956–1958 (U.S. Patent 3,047,228). The principal features of each contribution are illustrated and discussed. For purposes of comparison, a particular fixed algorithm has been encoded (as far as possible) in each of the languages. This research is based primarily on unpublished source materials, and the authors hope that they have been able to compile a fairly complete picture of the early developments in this area.},

Creative writing and reading social media platforms like Wattpad are challenging what it means to publish fiction in the early 21st century, and digital streaming platforms like Netflix, Hulu and others have begun looking to these platforms to source creative content for adaptation. Praxis on creative writing social media platforms is shaped by a complex and ongoing interplay between the technocultural and socio-economic conditions of platforms and their users. This article argues for an integration of publishing studies and platform studies by applying a media ecology framework to map behaviour on Wattpad, one of the largest creative writing social media platforms, and the relationships it has developed with other media companies. Specifically, it draws on and extends José van Dijck’s ((2013) The Culture of Connectivity: A Critical History of Social Media. New York, NY: Oxford University Press.) microsystem/ecosystem connective media model and proposes a broader conceptualisation of the entertainment ecosystem that incorporates adaptation of content across the book publishing and entertainment media sectors. Mapping these platforms alongside legacy media and publishing companies offers a productive framework for theorising contemporary entertainment media production within the platform media landscape.},

              , Van Dijck, Poell, and De Waal offer a comprehensive analysis of a connective world where platforms have penetrated the heart of societies—disrupting markets and labor relations, transforming social and civic practices, and affecting democratic processes.
              The Platform Society
              analyzes intense struggles between competing ideological systems and contesting societal actors—market, government, and civil society—asking who is or should be responsible for anchoring public values and the common good in a platform society. Public values include, of course, privacy, accuracy, safety, and security; but they also pertain to broader societal effects, such as fairness, accessibility, democratic control, and accountability. Such values are the very stakes in the struggle over the platformization of societies around the globe.
              The Platform Society
              highlights how these struggles play out in four private and public sectors: news, urban transport, health, and education. Some of these conflicts highlight local dimensions, for instance, fights over regulation between individual platforms and city councils, while others address the geopolitical level where power clashes between global markets and (supra-)national governments take place.},

Dominant social media deliver remarkably little to advance decision-making within digital communication infrastructures. The world cries for action, not likes. Organization after Social Media explores a range of social settings from arts and design, cultural politics, visual culture and creative industries, disorientated education and the crisis of pedagogy to media theory and activism.

I explore this shift with a historical perspective on, what I refer to as, platformization, or the rise of the platform as the dominant infrastructural and economic model of the social web and its consequences. Platformization entails the extension of social media platforms into the rest of the web and their drive to make external web data “platform ready.” The specific technological architecture and ontological distinctiveness of platforms will be examined by taking their programmability into account. I position platformization as a form of platform critique that inquires into the dynamics of the decentralization of platform features and the recentralization of “platform ready” data as a way to examine the consequences of the programmability of social media platforms for the web.},

This concept is used to examine MySpace and Facebook at the levels of aesthetics, code, culture, and appeal to marketers. I argue that instead of creating an architecture of abstraction in which users’ affect and content were easily reduced to marketer-friendly data sets, MySpace allowed users to create a cacophony of “pimped” profiles that undermined efforts to monetize user-generated content. In contrast, Facebook has proven to be extremely efficient at reducing users to commodifiable data sets within a muted, bland interface that does not detract from marketing efforts.},

The term has been deployed in both their populist appeals and their marketing pitches, sometimes as technical ‘platforms’, sometimes as ‘platforms’ from which to speak, sometimes as ‘platforms’ of opportunity. Whatever tensions exist in serving all of these constituencies are carefully elided. The term also fits their efforts to shape information policy, where they seek protection for facilitating user expression, yet also seek limited liability for what those users say.

	abstract = {The paper tackles the issue of uneven geographical representations on Wikipedia, the most visible and powerful user-generated encyclopaedia. In particular, it addresses language imbalances on Wikipedia with regard to geographical information and uneven spatial patterns of territory coverage on the different language versions in an attempt to verify expectations about the cultural factors that influence these imbalances and uneven spatial patterns. Ukraine is a promising case for testing the formulated expectations, as it has a large number of neighbouring countries, and most of them had political and cultural influence on its territory in the past. The volumes (word counts) of articles about the Ukrainian cities were analysed for seven language versions of Wikipedia, including the Ukrainian version and the versions of all bordering countries. The results show that historical geography is the strongest and central factor, and most of the key relic borders (former boundaries) can be traced. Ethnic composition appears to be another important factor, although weaker than the previous one. The role of the border factor is often unclear, but in some cases it definitely makes an impact and therefore cannot be completely ignored. Thus, the geographies of Wikipedia are not indifferent to the issues of ethnicity and geopolitics. The research calls into question the ability of modern Wikipedia to be a reliable and balanced source of geographical knowledge, as the described imbalances may create lopsided and biased geographical representations in people from different countries and nations.},

	abstract = {Good governance practices are pivotal to the success of Open Source Software (OSS) projects. However, the decision-making processes that are made available to stakeholders are at times incomplete and may remain buried and hidden in large amounts of software repository data. This work bridges this gap by unearthing enacted decision-making processes available for Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) from 1.54 million email messages that embody decisions made during the evolution of the Python language. This work employs a design science approach in operationalizing a framework called DeMaP miner that is used to discover hidden processes using information retrieval and information extraction techniques. It also uses process mining techniques to visualize the processes, and comparative structural analysis techniques to compare different decision processes. The work identifies a richer set of decision-making activities than those reported on the Python website and in prior research work (48 new decision activities, 199 new pathways and 6 new stages). The extracted decision process has been positively evaluated by a prominent member of the Python steering council. The extracted process can be used for process compliance checking and process improvement in OSS communities. Additionally, the DeMaP Miner framework can be extended and customized to suit other OSS projects, such as the OpenJDK project.},

It serves both as a solution to the problem of curating massive collections of user-generated content and as a rhetorical justification for platform owners when they decide to remove content. Flags are becoming a ubiquitous mechanism of governance—yet their meaning is anything but straightforward. In practice, the interactions between users, flags, algorithms, content moderators, and platforms are complex and highly strategic. Significantly, flags are asked to bear a great deal of weight, arbitrating both the relationship between users and platforms, and the negotiation around contentious public issues. In this essay, we unpack the working of the flag, consider alternatives that give greater emphasis to public deliberation, and consider the implications for online public discourse of this now commonplace yet rarely studied sociotechnical mechanism.},

I argue that Putnam's argument fails, but that it points out the need for a better understanding of the bridge between the theory of computation and the theory of physical systems: the relation of implementation. It also raises questions about the class of automata that can serve as a basis for understanding the mind. I develop an account of implementation, linked to an appropriate class of automata, such that the requirement that a system implement a given automaton places a very strong constraint on the system. This clears the way for computation to play a central role in the analysis of mind.},

	abstract = {Clojure was designed to be a general-purpose, practical functional language, suitable for use by professionals wherever its host language, e.g., Java, would be. Initially designed in 2005 and released in 2007, Clojure is a dialect of Lisp, but is not a direct descendant of any prior Lisp. It complements programming with pure functions of immutable data with concurrency-safe state management constructs that support writing correct multithreaded programs without the complexity of mutex locks.
            Clojure is intentionally hosted, in that it compiles to and runs on the runtime of another language, such as the JVM. This is more than an implementation strategy; numerous features ensure that programs written in Clojure can leverage and interoperate with the libraries of the host language directly and efficiently.
            In spite of combining two (at the time) rather unpopular ideas, functional programming and Lisp, Clojure has since seen adoption in industries as diverse as finance, climate science, retail, databases, analytics, publishing, healthcare, advertising and genomics, and by consultancies and startups worldwide, much to the career-altering surprise of its author.
            Most of the ideas in Clojure were not novel, but their combination puts Clojure in a unique spot in language design (functional, hosted, Lisp). This paper recounts the motivation behind the initial development of Clojure and the rationale for various design decisions and language constructs. It then covers its evolution subsequent to release and adoption.},

Various Wikipedia researchers have commended Wikidata for its collaborative nature and liberatory potential, yet less attention has been paid to the social and political implications of Wikidata. This article aims to advance work in this context by introducing the concept of semantic infrastructure and outlining how Wikidata’s role as semantic infrastructure is the primary vehicle by which Wikipedia has become infrastructural for digital platforms. We develop two key themes that build on questions of power that arise in infrastructure studies and apply to Wikidata: knowledge representation and data labor. We argue that considering these issues about Wikidata helps contextualize such infrastructural technologies within existing media and communication studies debates and highlights the contingencies upon which their outcomes depend.},

	abstract = {By looking at the politics of classification within machine learning systems, this article demonstrates why the automated interpretation of images is an inherently social and political project. We begin by asking what work images do in computer vision systems, and what is meant by the claim that computers can “recognize” an image? Next, we look at the method for introducing images into computer systems and look at how taxonomies order the foundational concepts that will determine how a system interprets the world. Then we turn to the question of labeling: how humans tell computers which words will relate to a given image. What is at stake in the way AI systems use these labels to classify humans, including by race, gender, emotions, ability, sexuality, and personality? Finally, we turn to the purposes that computer vision is meant to serve in our society—the judgments, choices, and consequences of providing computers with these capacities. Methodologically, we call this an archeology of datasets: studying the material layers of training images and labels, cataloguing the principles and values by which taxonomies are constructed, and analyzing how these taxonomies create the parameters of intelligibility for an AI system. By doing this, we can critically engage with the underlying politics and values of a system, and analyze which normative patterns of life are assumed, supported, and reproduced.},

These categories are proposed as the basis of a systematic taxonomy of the role of literature in AI research, evidencing literature’s significance in AI laboratory and professional cultures. The paper presents the results of this preliminary investigation in combination with a synthesis of existing evidence in each category of influence. The aim of this hybrid approach is to cohere research and evidence in this relatively new area of study, and to present new findings contextually, in order to provide the foundations for further qualitative and quantitative research.},

Computer science, being primarily concerned with developing interaction patterns, has \textit{information hiding} as its abstraction objective.

My reasons for those choices would, furthermore, have been very nearly the same as his, for we share numerous concerns and convictions. But, as I moved away from the starting point that body of literature provides, I would quite early have turned in a direction different from Boyd's, following a path that would have brought me quickly to a central metaphorlike process in science, one which he passes by. That path I shall have to sketch, if sense is to be made of my reactions to Boyd's proposals, and my remarks will therefore take the form of an excessively condensed epitome of parts of a position of my own, comments on Boyd's paper emerging along the way. That format seems all the more essential inasmuch as detailed analysis of individual points presented by Boyd is not likely to make sense to an audience largely ignorant of the causal theory of reference.Boyd begins by accepting Black's “interaction” view of metaphor. However metaphor functions, it neither presupposes nor supplies a list of the respects in which the subjects juxtaposed by metaphor are similar.},

	abstract = {Analogy and metaphor are central to scientific thought. They figure in discovery, as in Rutherford's analogy of the solar system for the atom or Faraday's use of lines of magnetized iron filings to reason about electric fields (Nersessian, 1984; Tweney, 1983). They are also used in teaching: novices are told to think of electricity as analogous to water flowing through pipes (Gentner \&amp; Gentner, 1983) or of a chemical process as analogous to a ball rolling down a hill (Van Lehn \&amp; J. S. Brown, 1980). Yet for all its usefulness, analogical thinking is never formally taught to us. We seem to think of it as a natural human skill, and of its use in science as a straightforward extension of its use in commonsense reasoning. For example, William James believed that “men, taken historically, reason by analogy long before they have learned to reason by abstract characters” (James, 1890, vol. II, p. 363). All this points to an appealing intuition: that a faculty for analogical reasoning is an innate part of human cognition, and that the concept of a sound, inferentially useful analogy is universal.In this essay we question this intuition. We analyze the way in which analogy and metaphor have been used at different points in the history of Western scientific thought, tracing their use backward from the present time. We begin by laying out the current framework for analogical reasoning, followed by two examples that conform to the modern aesthetic, those of Sadi Carnot (1796–1832) and Robert Boyle (1627–1691).},

An important challenge for these accounts is explaining how abstract concepts, which do not directly call upon sensory or motor information, can be informed by experience. We propose that metaphor is one important vehicle guiding the development and use of abstract concepts. Metaphors allow us to draw on concrete, familiar domains to acquire and reason about abstract concepts. Additionally, repeated metaphoric use drawing on particular aspects of concrete experience can result in the development of new abstract representations. These abstractions, which are derived from embodied experience but lack much of the sensorimotor information associated with it, can then be flexibly applied to understand new situations.},

	abstract = {In philosophy of science, abstraction tends to be subsumed under representation, often being described as the omission of a target's features when it is represented. This approach to abstraction sidesteps cognitive aspects of abstraction processes. However, cognitive aspects of abstraction are important in understanding the role of historically grounded epistemic criteria supporting modeling in science. Drawing on recent work on the relation between metaphor and abstraction, we introduce the concept of paths of abstraction, and use historical and contemporary examples to point to their role in guiding the development of relevance criteria which support modeling strategies in science.},

	abstract = {Critical Code Studies often relies on the textual representation of code in order to derive extra-textual significance, with less focus on how code performs and in what contexts. In this paper we analyze three case studies in which a literal reading of each program’s code is effectively nonsense. In their performance, however, the programs generate meaning. To discern this meaning, we use the framework of nonmaterial performance (NMP), which is based on four tenets: code abstracts, code performs, code acts within a network, and code is vibrant. We begin with what is to our knowledge the oldest example of nonsense code: a program (now lost) from the 1950s that caused a Univac 1 computer to hum “Happy Birthday”. Second, we critique Firestarter, a processor stress test from the Technical University of Dresden. Finally, we analyze one of the family of processor power side-channel attacks known collectively as Platypus. In each case, the text of the code is a wholly unreliable guide to its extra-textual significance. This paper builds on work in Critical Code Studies by bringing in methodologies from actor-network theory and political science, examining code from a performance-studies perspective and with expertise from computer science. Code can certainly be read as literature, but ultimately it is text written to be performed. Imagining and observing the performance forces the critic to engage with the code in its own network. The three examples we have chosen to critique here are outliers---very little code in the world is purposed to manipulate the physical machine. Nonsense shows us the opportunity that nonmaterial performance creates: to decenter text from privileged position and to recenter code as a performance.},

	abstract = {The premise of this article is that a basic understanding of the composition and functioning of large language models is critically urgent. To that end, we extract a representational map of OpenAI’s GPT-2 with what we articulate as two classes of deep learning code, that which pertains to the model and that which underwrites applications built around the model. We then verify this map through case studies of two popular GPT-2 applications: the text adventure game, AI Dungeon, and the language art project, This Word Does Not Exist. Such an exercise allows us to test the potential of Critical Code Studies when the object of study is deep learning code and to demonstrate the validity of code as an analytical focus for researchers in the subfields of Critical Artificial Intelligence and Critical Machine Learning Studies. More broadly, however, our work draws attention to the means by which ordinary users might interact with, and even direct, the behavior of deep learning systems, and by extension works toward demystifying some of the auratic mystery of “AI.” What is at stake is the possibility of achieving an informed sociotechnical consensus about the responsible applications of large language models, as well as a more expansive sense of their creative capabilities — indeed, understanding how and where engagement occurs allows all of us to become more active participants in the development of machine learning systems.},

The text follows the development of two central concepts, those of pure difference and complex repetition. It shows how the two concepts are related, difference implying divergence and decentring, repetition being associated with displacement and disguising. The work moves deftly between Hegel, Kierkegaard, Freud, Althusser and Nietzsche to establish a fundamental critique of Western metaphysics, and has been a central text in initiating the shift in French thought - away from Hegel and Marx, towards Nietzsche and Freud.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In late nineteenth-century South Asia, the arrival of print fostered a dynamic and interactive literary culture. There, within the pages of Urdu-language periodicals and newspapers, readers found a public sphere that not only catered to their interests but encouraged their reactions to featured content. \textit{Cosmopolitan Dreams} brings this culture to light, showing how literature became a site in which modern daily life could be portrayed and satirized, the protocols of modernity challenged, and new futures imagined.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}
{\textless}p{\textgreater}Drawing on never-before-translated Urdu fiction and prose and focusing on the novel and satire, Jennifer Dubrow shows that modern Urdu literature was defined by its practice of self-critique and parody. Urdu writers resisted the cultural models offered by colonialism, creating instead a global community of imagination in which literary models could freely circulate and be readapted, mixed, and drawn upon to develop alternative lines of thinking. Highlighting the participation of readers and writers from diverse social and religious backgrounds, the book reveals an Urdu cosmopolis where lively debates thrived in newspapers, literary journals, and letters to the editor, shedding fresh light on the role of readers in shaping vernacular literary culture. Arguing against current understandings of Urdu as an exclusively Muslim language, Dubrow demonstrates that in the late nineteenth century, Urdu was a cosmopolitan language spoken by a transregional, transnational community that eschewed identities of religion, caste, and class.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}
{\textless}p{\textgreater}The Urdu cosmopolis pictured here was soon fractured by the forces of nationalism and communalism. Even so, Dubrow is able to establish the persistence of Urdu cosmopolitanism into the present and shows that Urdu’s strong tradition as a language of secular, critical modernity did not end in the late nineteenth century but continues to flourish in film, television, and on line. In lucid prose, Dubrow makes the dynamic world of colonial Urdu print culture come to life in a way that will interest scholars of modern Asian literatures, South Asian literature and history, cosmopolitanism, and the history of print culture.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
